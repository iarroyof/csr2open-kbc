15894099,Breast cancer remains a public - health issue on a global scale.
15894099,We report new information about the disease from the past 5 years.
15894099,"Early age at first birth , increasing parity , and tamoxifen use are related to long - term lifetime reduction in breast - cancer risk."
15894099,Ductal carcinomas in situ has been suggested to be renamed ductal intraepithelial neoplasia to emphasise its non-life-threatening nature.
15894099,"An alternative approach , the progenitor / stem cell theory , predicts that only some tumour cells cause cancer progression and that these should be targeted by treatment."
15894099,"Mammography and ultrasonography are still the most effective for women with non-dense and dense breast tissues , respectively."
15894099,"Additionally , MRI , lymphatic mapping , the nipple - sparing mastectomy , partial breast irradiation , neoadjuvant systemic therapy , and adjuvant treatments are promising for subgroups of breast - cancer patients."
15894099,"Although tamoxifen can be offered for endocrine - responsive disease , aromatase inhibitors are increasingly used."
15894099,Assessment of potential molecular targets is now important in primary diagnosis.
15894099,Tyrosine - kinase inhibitors and other drugs with anti-angiogenesis properties are currently undergoing preclinical investigations.
31456179,Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and ranks second among causes for cancer related death in women.
31456179,Evidence in literature has shown that the past and ongoing research has an enormous implication in improving the clinical outcome in breast cancer.
31456179,"This has been attributed to the progress made in the realm of screening , diagnosis and therapeutic strategies engaged in breast cancer management."
31456179,"However , poor prognosis in TNBC and drug resistance presents major inhibitions which are also current challenges for containing the disease."
31456179,"Similarly , a focal point of concern is the rising rate of breast cancer incidence and mortality among the population of under developed world."
31456179,"In this chapter , an overview of the current practices for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and associated impediments has been provided."
20521754,Understanding breast cancer treatment options can help family physicians care for their patients during and after cancer treatment.
20521754,"This article reviews typical treatments based on stage , histology , and biomarkers."
20521754,Lobular carcinoma in situ does not require treatment.
20521754,Ductal carcinoma in situ can progress to invasive cancer and is treated with breast - conserving surgery and radiation therapy without further lymph node exploration or systemic therapy.
20521754,Stages I and II breast cancers are usually treated with breast - conserving surgery and radiation therapy.
20521754,Radiation therapy following breast - conserving surgery decreases mortality and recurrence.
20521754,"Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered for most breast cancers with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes , and it does not have the adverse effects of arm swelling and pain that are associated with axillary lymph node dissection."
20521754,"Choice of adjuvant systemic therapy depends on lymph node involvement , hormone receptor status , ERBB2 ( formerly HER2 or HER2 / neu ) overexpression , and patient age and menopausal status."
20521754,"In general , node - positive breast cancer is treated systemically with chemotherapy , endocrine therapy ( for hormone receptor - positive cancer ) , and trastuzumab ( for cancer overexpressing ERBB2 )."
20521754,Anthracycline - and taxane - containing chemotherapeutic regimens are active against breast cancer.
20521754,Stage III breast cancer typically requires induction chemotherapy to downsize the tumor to facilitate breast - conserving surgery.
20521754,"Inflammatory breast cancer , although considered stage III , is aggressive and requires induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy , rather than breastconserving surgery , as well as axillary lymph node dissection and chest wall radiation."
20521754,"Prognosis is poor in women with recurrent or metastatic ( stage IV ) breast cancer , and treatment options must balance benefits in length of life and reduced pain against harms from treatment."

28260181,"Worldwide , breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women , and its incidence and mortality rates are expected to increase significantly the next years."
28260181,Recently the researchers ' interest has been attracted by breast cancer arising in young women.
28260181,"Current evidence suggests that in women aged < 45 years , breast cancer is unquestionably the leading cause of cancer - related deaths."
28260181,This type of cancer seems to be highly heterogeneous and has potentially aggressive and complex biological features.
28260181,"However , management strategies , recommendations and options are not age based and the ' complex ' biology of this type of cancer remains uncertain and unexplored."
28260181,"In this review , we summarize the latest scientific information on breast cancer arising in young women highlighting the heterogeneity and the complex nature of this type of cancer."

29284222,Introduction : Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and is the second cancer frequently occurring worldwide of newly - diagnosed cancers.
29284222,"There is much evidence showing the influence of life style and environmental factors on the development of mammary gland cancer ( high - fat diet , alcohol consumption , lack of physical exercise ) , the elimination of which ( primary prevention ) may contribute to a decrease in morbidity and mortality."
29284222,"Secondary prevention , comprising diagnostic tests ( e.g. mammography , ultrasonography , magnetic resonance imaging , breast self - examination , as well as modern and more precise imaging methods ) help the early detection of tumours or lesions predisposing to tumours."
29284222,Objective : The aim of this study paper is to review current knowledge and reports regarding primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.
29284222,"State of knowledge : It is estimated that nearly 70 % of malign tumours are caused by environmental factors , whereas in breast cancer this percentage reaches 90 - 95 %."
29284222,"There are national programmes established in many countries to fight cancer , where both types of prevention are stressed as serving to decrease morbidity and mortality due to cancers."
29284222,Conclusions : Cancer prevention is currently playing a key role in the fight against the disease.
29284222,"Behaviour modification , as well as greater awareness among women regarding breast cancer , may significantly contribute towards reducing the incidence of this cancer."
29284222,"Another important aspect is the number of women undergoing diagnostic tests , which still remains at an unsatisfactory level."
21969133,"In this article , the American Cancer Society provides an overview of female breast cancer statistics in the United States , including trends in incidence , mortality , survival , and screening."
21969133,"Approximately 230,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 39,520 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur among US women in 2011."
21969133,Breast cancer incidence rates were stable among all racial / ethnic groups from 2004 to 2008.
21969133,"Breast cancer death rates have been declining since the early 1990s for all women except American Indians / Alaska Natives , among whom rates have remained stable."
21969133,"Disparities in breast cancer death rates are evident by state , socioeconomic status , and race / ethnicity."
21969133,"While significant declines in mortality rates were observed for 36 states and the District of Columbia over the past 10 years , rates for 14 states remained level."
21969133,Analyses by county - level poverty rates showed that the decrease in mortality rates began later and was slower among women residing in poor areas.
21969133,"As a result , the highest breast cancer death rates shifted from the affluent areas to the poor areas in the early 1990s."
21969133,"Screening rates continue to be lower in poor women compared with non-poor women , despite much progress in increasing mammography utilization."
21969133,"In 2008 , 51.4 % of poor women had undergone a screening mammogram in the past 2 years compared with 72.8 % of non-poor women."
21969133,Encouraging patients aged 40 years and older to have annual mammography and a clinical breast examination is the single most important step that clinicians can take to reduce suffering and death from breast cancer.
21969133,Clinicians should also ensure that patients at high risk of breast cancer are identified and offered appropriate screening and follow - up.
21969133,"Continued progress in the control of breast cancer will require sustained and increased efforts to provide high - quality screening , diagnosis , and treatment to all segments of the population."
24716497,Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and ranks second among causes for cancer related death in women.
24716497,The ability to identify and diagnose breast cancer has improved markedly.
24716497,Treatment decisions which were based in the past predominantly on the anatomic extent of the disease are shifting to the underlying biological mechanisms.
24716497,"Gene array technology has led to the recognition that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease composed of different biological subtypes , and genetic profiling enables response to chemotherapy to be predicted."
24716497,Breast conservation became an established standard of care and the oncoplastic approach enables wide excisions without compromising the natural shape of the breast.
24716497,Sentinel lymph node biopsy has replaced axillary dissection as the standard procedure to stage the axilla and spared many patients the excess morbidity of axillary dissection.
24716497,Targeted therapy to the oestrogen receptor plays a major role in systemic therapy ; pathways responsible for endocrine resistance have been targeted as well.
24716497,Biological therapy has been developed to target HER2 receptor and combination of antibody drug conjugates linked cytotoxic therapy to HER2 antibodies.
24716497,Meaningful improvements in survival resulted from the new effective systemic agents and patients with metastasis are likely to have a longer survival.
26059925,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women , and survivors with this diagnosis account for almost one fourth of the over 14 million cancer survivors in the US."
26059925,"After several decades of basic and clinical trials research , we have learned much about the heterogeneity of breast cancer and have evolved a complex and multidisciplinary treatment approach to the disease."
26059925,"Increasingly , we are paying attention to the long term and late effects of breast cancer treatment , and this is largely the subject of this volume."
26059925,"In this chapter , the authors introduce the topic of breast cancer survivorship and highlight the organization and content of this volume , briefly describing the contents of the subsequent chapters."
28862198,It has been suggested that physical activity in breast cancer patients can not only improve quality of life.
28862198,"Influences on physical and psychological levels have been evaluated , but effects on the immune system of breast cancer patients are hardly known."
28862198,A PubMed search identified relevant trials and meta - analyses from 1970 to 2013.
28862198,This review summarizes the results of international studies and the current discussion of effects of physical activity on the immune system of breast cancer patients.
28862198,Highlighted are effects of physical activity on the immune system.
28862198,Seven original articles and 14 reviews included in this review.
28862198,"Two original and the review articles includes other tumor entities besides breast cancer.Evaluated methods such as dose - response relationships for exercise in oncology , hardly exist."
28862198,Increased immunological anti-cancer activity due to physical activity is probably mediated via an increase in number and cytotoxicity of monocytes and natural killer cells and cytokines.
28395765,"This review will give a general overview of the impact of breast cancer , as well as breast cancer risk factors , identification of high - risk groups , screening modalities , and guidelines for screening average - risk and high - risk individuals , including a case discussion of the primary care provider 's approach to screening."
30005774,Inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC ) is a rare form of breast cancer that accounts for only 2 % to 4 % of all breast cancer cases.
30005774,"Despite its low incidence , IBC contributes to 7 % to 10 % of breast cancer caused mortality."
30005774,"Despite ongoing international efforts to formulate better diagnosis , treatment , and research , the survival of patients with IBC has not been significantly improved , and there are no therapeutic agents that specifically target IBC to date."
30005774,The authors present a comprehensive overview that aims to assess the present and new management strategies of IBC.
31491663,"Metaplastic breast carcinomas ( MPBC ) are rare , aggressive and relatively chemorefractory tumors with a high unmet need."
31491663,"While most are "" triple negative "" and lack expression of estrogen , progesterone and HER2 receptors , MPBC are associated with worse outcomes compared to conventional triple negative invasive tumors."
31491663,"MPBCs are genetically heterogeneous and harbor somatic mutations , most frequently in TP53 , PIK3CA and PTEN , with emerging studies suggesting a role for novel targeted therapies."
31491663,These tumors have also been associated with overexpression of PD - L1 and tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes suggesting an endogenous immune response and therefore a rationale for treatment with immunotherapies.
31491663,"Here , we focus on therapeutic options for this difficult to treat breast cancer subtype and encourage physicians to consider targeted therapies / immunotherapies as part of ongoing clinical trials."
24283956,Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the United States and around the world.
24283956,"Although widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapeutic and hormonal agents has improved mortality from breast cancer , it remains challenging to determine on an individual basis who will benefit from such treatments and who will be likely to encounter toxicities."
24283956,"With the rising costs of healthcare and the introduction of new targeted therapies , use of biomarkers has emerged as a method of assisting with breast cancer diagnosis , prognosis , prediction of therapeutic response , and surveillance of disease during and after treatment."
24283956,"In the following review , prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers , their utility in the management of patients with breast cancer , and current recommendations regarding their clinical use will be discussed."
24171821,"Due to the high heterogeneity of breast cancers , numerous recent patents describe improved methods of detection and classification which promise better patient prognosis and treatment."
24171821,"In particular , there has been a shift towards more effective genetic screening to identify specific mutations associated with breast tumours , which may lead to "" personalised medicine "" with improved outcomes."
24171821,Two challenging areas of breast cancer research involve the development of treatments for the highly aggressive triple negative breast cancer subtype as well as the chemotherapy - resistant cancer stem cell subpopulation.
24171821,"In addition , despite numerous recent advances in breast cancer treatment in woman , male breast cancer remains poorly understood and there are limited therapies available which are developed specifically for men."
24171821,This review serves to report on important developments in the treatment of breast malignancies patented in the past two years as well as to highlight the current gaps in the field of breast cancer therapeutics and areas which require further study.
27533387,"Essential facts Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK , with around 60,000 new cases diagnosed each year , according to the charity Breast Cancer Care."
27533387,"Over a lifetime , women have a one in eight risk of developing it."
31421262,Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women throughout the world and is the major cause of most cancer - related deaths.
31421262,"Several explanations account for the high rate of mortality of breast cancer , and metastasis to vital organs is identified as the principal cause."
31421262,"Over the past few years , intensive efforts have demonstrated that breast cancer exhibits metastatic heterogeneity with distinct metastatic precedence to various organs , giving rise to differences in prognoses and responses to therapy in breast cancer patients."
31421262,"Bone , lung , liver , and brain are generally accepted as the primary target sites of breast cancer metastasis."
31421262,"However , the underlying molecular mechanism of metastatic heterogeneity of breast cancer remains to be further elucidated."
31421262,"Recently , the advent of novel genomic and pathologic approaches as well as technological breakthroughs in imaging analysis and animal modelling have yielded an unprecedented change in our understanding of the heterogeneity of breast cancer metastasis and provided novel insight for establishing more effective therapeutics."
31421262,This review summarizes recent molecular mechanisms and emerging concepts on the metastatic heterogeneity of breast cancer and discusses the potential of identifying specific molecules against tumor cells or tumor microenvironments to thwart the development of metastatic disease and improve the prognosis of breast cancer patients.
31669239,Introduction : Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer - related death in women worldwide.
31669239,"Despite the early detection of breast cancer and increasing knowledge of its biology and chemo - resistance , metastatic breast cancer is largely incurable disease."
31669239,"We provide a review of the intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity , explain the differences between triple - negative breast cancer subtypes."
31669239,"Also , we describe the interaction of breast tumor cells with their microenvironment cells and explain how this interaction contributes to the tumor progression , metastasis formation and resistance to the treatment."
31669239,Discussion : One of the main causes that complicate the treatment is tumor heterogeneity.
31669239,It is observed among patients ( intertumor heterogeneity ) and in each individual tumor ( intratumor heterogeneity ).
31669239,"In the case of intratumor heterogeneity , the tumor consists of different phenotypical cell populations."
31669239,"During breast cancer subtype identification , a small piece of solid tumor tissue does not necessarily represent all the tumor composition."
31669239,"Breast tumor cell phenotypical differences may appear due to cell localization in different tumor sites , unique response to the treatment , cell interaction with tumor microenvironment or tumor cell interaction with each other."
31669239,This heterogeneity may lead to breast cancer aggressiveness and challenging treatment.
31669239,Conclusion : Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of tumor heterogeneity that are relevant to the development of treatment resistance is a major area of research.
31669239,Identification of differences between populations and their response to anticancer drugs would help to predict the potential resistance to chemotherapy and thus would help to select the most suitable anticancer treatment.
27888421,"Purpose : The current American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC ) staging manual uses tumor size , lymph node , and metastatic status to stage breast cancer across different subtypes."
27888421,We examined the prognosis of triple - negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) versus non-TNBC within the same stages and sub-stages to evaluate whether TNBC had worse prognosis than non-TNBC.
27888421,"Methods : We reviewed the National Cancer Institute Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER ) data and identified 158,358 patients diagnosed with breast cancer from 2010 to 2012."
27888421,The overall survival ( OS ) time and breast cancer cause - specific survival time were compared between patients with TNBC and non-TNBC in each stage and sub-stages.
27888421,The results were validated using a dataset of 2049 patients with longer follow - up from our institution.
27888421,"Results : Compared with patients with non-TNBC , patients with TNBC had worse OS and breast cancer cause - specific survival time in every stage and sub-stage in univariate and multivariate analyses adjusting for age , race , tumor grade , and surgery and radiation treatments in the SEER data."
27888421,The worse OS time in patients with TNBC was validated in our institutional dataset.
27888421,Conclusions : Patients with TNBC have worse survival than patients with non-TNBC.
27888421,The new AJCC staging manual should consider breast cancer biomarker information.
29952495,Breast cancer is by far the most common malignancy in women.
29952495,The median age is 64 years.
29952495,Stage at diagnosis and biological features determine the prognosis.
29952495,"Patients with early breast cancer , with locally advanced disease and with locoregional relapse can be cured."
29952495,Modern treatment is multimodal.
29952495,"It includes surgery , radiation and drug therapy."
29952495,Patients with metastatic disease are treated with palliative intent.
29952495,Aims are alleviation of symptoms and prolongation of survival.
29952495,Breast cancer specific mortality has continually decreased in the past 10 years.
29952495,Five year survival rate is 87 % in Germany.
29952495,Patients with early breast cancer have an even higher chance of cure.
31209841,Precision medicine approaches have found applications in the treatment of several tumor types and have led to rapid advancement in the number of available therapies for some difficult - to - treat diseases.
31209841,"In comparison to tumors like EGFR - mutated lung cancer , and BRAF - mutated melanoma for example , precision medicine in breast cancer is still in its infancy despite the much earlier identification of targets like ER and HER2."
31209841,"Though significant progress has been made in new therapies for hormone - receptor - positive and HER2 - positive breast cancers , identification of molecular heterogeneity and lack of other valid reproducible targets in triple - negative breast cancer remain a challenge."
31209841,"In this chapter , we outline the recent advances in technology and targeted treatments for breast cancer , the remaining challenges and ongoing efforts to address these to make precision medicine a reality for all breast cancer patients."
29231918,Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women around the globe.
29231918,It is also the world 's first cause of female deaths from cancer.
29231918,"With the introduction of screening programs in most developed countries , more and more cases of this cancer are diagnosed at local or localized stages , enabling radical treatment to be successful."
29231918,"At the same time , systemic treatment of early breast cancer is one of the most complex issues in clinical oncology."
29231918,"Because of the many prognostic factors that need to be taken into account when considering eligibility for treatment such as age , reproductive status ( before or after menopause ) , type of cancer and severity of the disease , it is impossible to establish clear standards of conduct for many clinical situations."
29231918,"The international biennial St Gallen conference , the world 's most prominent breast cancer specialists , who are struggling to address major clinical problems in the treatment of early breast cancer."
29231918,"St Gallen 's recommendations address all issues related to the treatment of early breast cancer ( in particular surgery , radiotherapy , and systemic treatment ) and are set by a group of 52 experts by voting."
29231918,This method allows us to establish consensus on issues that can not be clearly identified in the results of randomized clinical trials.
29231918,"In this way , more than 200 clinical issues were answered."
29231918,"The most important changes in day - to - day practice are the duration of ajuvant hormone therapy ( 10 instead of 5 years ) , the possibility of using aromatase inhibitors ( in combination with ovarian function suppresion ) in premenopausal women with high risk of recurrence and the timing of sentinel node biopsy after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy."
29231918,"There are also recommendations , which patients should undergo genetic testing to assess the risk of recurrence of breast cancer."
30007834,Background : Male breast cancer is rare and understudied compared with female breast cancer.
30007834,A current comparison with female breast cancer could assist in bridging this gap.
30007834,"Although conflicting data have been reported on male and female survival outcomes , data from 1973 through 2005 in the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER ) program have demonstrated that the improvement in breast cancer survival in men has fallen behind that of women."
30007834,"As treatment for breast cancer has improved significantly , an updated analysis using a contemporary population is necessary."
30007834,Materials and methods : An analysis of SEER data from patients with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer from 2005 to 2010 were included.
30007834,"A Cox regression model was used to examine the association between sex and breast cancer mortality after controlling for prognostic factors , including age , race , marital status , disease stage , estrogen and progesterone receptor status , lymph node involvement , tumor grade , surgery , and geography."
30007834,Subgroup analyses were performed by race and stage.
30007834,"Results : We included a total of 289,673 breast cancer cases ( 2054 men ) with a diagnosis from 2005 to 2010."
30007834,The 5 - year survival rate for male patients was lower than that for female patients ( 82.8 % vs. 88.5 % ).
30007834,"After controlling for other factors , the risk of death in men was 43 % greater than that in women during the follow - up period ( hazard ratio , 1.43 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.26 - 1.61 )."
30007834,Similar results were noted in the race and stage subgroup analyses.
30007834,"Conclusion : In recent years , male breast cancer patients have had worse survival outcomes compared with those of female patients."
30005779,The role of operative therapy in stage IV breast cancer continues to evolve with advances in therapy and improvements in survival among this population.
30005779,Traditionally surgery was performed with palliative intent to alleviate symptoms related to the intact breast primary.
30005779,"Several retrospective studies have challenged this paradigm , demonstrating survival advantage with surgery in de novo metastatic disease."
30005779,Prospective studies are ongoing and maturing data.
30005779,A comprehensive approach to local therapy following systemic therapy may be beneficial to achieve improved survival outcome associated with stage IV - no evidence of disease and to decrease local failure in inflammatory breast cancer.
26989051,It has become customary to extrapolate from the results of treatment trials for female breastcancer and apply them to males with the disease.
26989051,In the absence of results from national and international randomised trials for male breast cancer ( MBC ) this appears superficially to be an appropriate response.
26989051,Closer examination of available data reveals that aspects of the aetiology and treatment of MBC do not fit the simplistic model that men usually have endocrine sensitive tumours which behave like those in postmenopausal women.
26989051,"Most females and males with breast cancer have none of the recognised risk factors , indicating the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of this disease."
26989051,Several studies have compared epidemiological risk factors for MBC and female breast cancer ( FBC ) but many have been blighted by small numbers.
26989051,"In comparison with FBC there is a larger proportion of BRCA2 tumours , ( occurring in 10 % of MBC ) , and underrepresentation of BRCA1 tumours ( found in only 1 % ) , suggesting significant differences in the genetic aetiology of MBC and FBC."
26989051,Genome - wide association studies in FBC reported single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 12 novel independent loci were consistently associated with disease but for MBC 2 SNPs had a significantly increased risk.
26989051,"Molecular profiles of matched cancers in males and females showed a gender - associated modulation of major processes including energy metabolism , regulation of translation , matrix remodelling and immune recruitment."
26989051,Immunohistochemistry for kinase inhibitor proteins ( KIPs ) p27Kip1 and p21Waf1 indicate a significant difference in the immunostaining of tumours from male patients compared with females.
26989051,MBC is almost always estrogen receptor positive ( ER + ve ) and so systemic treatment is usually endocrine.
26989051,With evidence in FBC that aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen in the postmenopausal it was seemingly logical that the same would be true for MBC.
26989051,Results however suggest less efficacy with AIs and an increase in risk of mortality compared to tamoxifen.
26989051,The overall survival in male breast cancer was significantly better after adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen compared to an aromatase inhibitor.
26989051,These important biological differences point the way to the development of new therapies for MBC based on differences rather than similarities with FBC.
31157481,Breast cancer ( BC ) is one of the most widespread malignancies in women worldwide.
31157481,"Breast cancer is mainly classified into a few key molecular subtypes in accordance with hormone and growth factor receptor expression , etc.."
31157481,"In spite of numerous advances in the remedy of breast cancer , the development of metastatic disease remains an untreatable and repeated basis of cancer death for women."
31157481,"Preclinical and clinical studies of immunotherapy in cancer remedy have been in progress for the past quite a few decades by an effort to accelerate , augment , and modulate the immune system to spot and devastate cancer cells."
31157481,"Advancement of cancer immunotherapy is rapidly increasing with eminent and most interesting therapy compared to other therapy like targeted therapy , cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiation as well as surgery."
31157481,"Cancer immunotherapy , also known as biological therapy , which denotes the controlling and by means of the patient 's own immune system to goal the cancer cells rather than using an extrinsic therapy."
31157481,"In that way , focusing of cancer immunotherapy developing mediators that stimulates or enhances the immune system 's recognition and destroying the cancer cells."
31157481,This review describes a holistic outlook and deeper understanding of the biology of immunotherapy within the system of tumor microenvironment of breast cancer that improve clinical research and constructive impact on the study conclusion.
30320989,"In Belgium , breast cancer is the most frequent women 's cancer accounting for to 35.3 % of the cases."
30320989,"In 2013 , 10,778 newly diagnosed breast cancers have been reported in Belgium."
30320989,Breast cancer has a relatively good prognosis with a 5 year overall survival of 88 %.
30320989,Survival will be different regarding the subtype and stage at diagnosis.
30320989,The review of the literature and the guidelines from ESMO and ASCO regarding the follow - up of patients with early breast cancer will be used as references.
30320989,International guidelines recommend clinical visits ( frequencies depending of the subtypes of breast cancer ) with an annual mammography associated with an echography.
30320989,"MRI Imaging should be performed in "" at risk "" patients."
30320989,A more extensive exploration should be proceede when a relapse is suspected during follow up.
30320989,"Indeed , studies have shown that intensive follow - up with several additional exams detect more recurrences without any impact on overall survival and lead to anxiety."
30320989,The follow - up of patients treated for breast cancer has several objectives : - Detect a local recurrence or a second tumor ; - Diagnosis of a distant relapse ; - Detect side effects of treatment ; - Psycho - social impact of the disease and improve the quality of life.

30704209,"Breast reconstruction is an option to improve cosmetic outcomes and quality of life for the patients received mastectomy , this procedure has attracted a lot of attention."
30704209,The breast reconstruction surgery is recommended by the 2018 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Breast Cancer in patients with appropriate indications.
30704209,"Despite the high proportion of breast reconstruction after mastectomy in western countries , Chinese breast surgeon should objectively understand the differences in breast structure and cultural backgrounds between Chinese and foreign women , and conduct rigorous clinical practice on the basis of calm thinking."
30704209,"In particular , it should be clearly recognized that we have more local advanced and high - risk cases in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients."
30704209,Making efforts to improve the overall survival for patients with breast cancer must be the top priority for our surgeon.
30704209,"Breast reconstruction for all patients without identifying the distinction of personal characters and indications should be avoided , and the pursuing of high proportion of clinical data with no consideration of the realities of clinical practice in China should also be avoided."
30704209,The indication of breast reconstruction for breast cancer patients received mastectomy must be strictly determined by the surgeon.
32378709,Breast cancer is highly sensitive to systemic therapy.
32378709,High probability of pathological complete response suggests a clinical question that omitting surgery is an effective alternative to surgery in breast cancer showing clinical complete response to primary systemic therapy.
32378709,"However , the validity of omitting surgery for early breast cancer after primary systemic therapy has not been sufficiently established ; thus , even if pathological complete response is expected in patients showing clinical complete response , excision of the primary tumor site remains the standard treatment of breast cancer."
32378709,"Inappropriate omitting surgery increases the incidence of local recurrence , which can be the risk of a subsequent distant metastasis and reduced overall survival."
32378709,"To achieve acceptable local control rate , omitting surgery should be investigated in patients with early breast cancer where a high percentage of pathological complete response , a high concordance rate between clinical complete response and pathological complete response and an acceptable local control rate are expected."
32378709,This review presents concept and ongoing clinical trials for omitting surgery for patients with breast cancer showing clinical complete response to primary systemic therapy.
32239991,"In 1970 , 50 years ago , I had headed the newly established Academic Unit of Surgery at the Westminster Medical School for 10 years."
32239991,"Since my appointment there in 1960 , and for the next 30 years , one of my main interests as a general surgeon was the management of diseases of the breast - breast cancer in particular."
10614359,"Nurse practitioners must be aware of the standard treatments for breast cancer whether they are referring a symptomatic patient to a breast cancer specialist , are involved in the actual treatment process , or are providing ongoing care for patients after completion of therapy."

1775816,"Bilateral breast cancer has a cumulative incidence of 7 % to 20 % in patients with primary operable breast cancer , and the majority of these lesions are metachronous."
1775816,A consensus on the management of the contralateral breast has been elusive.
1775816,Much of the confusion arises from the fact that there exist marked differences of opinion regarding the impact of a second primary breast cancer on the overall prognosis.
1775816,"The risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer is influenced by the age of the patient , the presence of in situ disease , lobular histology of this new lesion , multicentricity , exposure to certain types of ionizing irradiation , and , possibly , family history of breast cancer."
1775816,"Management options include observation ( clinical and mammographic surveillance ) , contralateral biopsy , and , rarely , prophylactic mastectomy."
1775816,"It is hoped that trials of breast cancer prevention , employing drugs such as tamoxifen , will identify agents capable of abrogating the risk of contralateral breast cancer and improve the ultimate outcome."
23412797,"Over the last decade , our knowledge in somatic genetic events related to breast cancer has increased - enormously."
23412797,"Through usage of various genome - wide molecular approaches , it has become increasingly clear that breast cancer is a vastly heterogeneous disease."
23412797,"Microarray - based gene expression profiling has divided breast cancer into five distinct intrinsic subtypes termed basal - like , HER2 - enriched , normal - like , luminal A , and luminal B. Importantly , these subtypes are closely correlated to clinical variables as well as different outcomes , with luminal A tumors as the good prognostic group."
23412797,"Initial studies using genome - wide DNA copy number data broadly partitioned breast cancers into three types , complex , amplifier , and simple , and moreover associated distinct copy number changes with the intrinsic subtypes defined by gene expression profiles."
23412797,"More recently , this genomic classification was refined into six genomic subtypes demonstrating strong resemblance to the intrinsic gene expression classification."
23412797,"Additionally , inherited BRCA1 - and BRCA2 - mutated tumors were significantly correlated to specific subtypes."
23412797,"In this chapter , we will review the current status regarding genomic subtypes of nonfamilial breast cancer."
21908782,Mammography and other imaging modalities help diagnose initial breast cancers in nearly 200 000 women per year in the United States.
21908782,"Advances in these methods and in breast cancer treatment mean that more people with a personal history of breast cancer are living longer , and these survivors face ongoing risk of breast cancer recurrence , distant metastasis , and death."
21908782,Survivors also need regular follow - up and surveillance or diagnostic imaging to detect these recurrences early.
21908782,"This article focuses on breast cancer survivors , their follow - up , and surveillance imaging."

24029122,"Breast cancer is a substantial contributor to adolescent and young adult ( AYA ) malignancies , defined as a diagnosis of cancer between the ages of 15 and 39."
24029122,"In the United States , 6.6 % of breast cancer cases are diagnosed among women younger than 40 years."
24029122,"When breast cancer occurs in AYAs , it typically has a worse prognosis and more - aggressive phenotype ; higher proportions of high - grade and later - stage tumors ; lower estrogen receptor positivity ; and , in some studies , higher expression of HER2."
24029122,Age - specific differences in the biology of AYA breast cancer have been explored in large - scale genomic studies with mixed results.
24029122,"Although some studies suggest that AYA breast cancer has a unique biology , others have shown that its aggressive nature is the result of higher frequencies of aggressive breast cancer subtypes among younger patients."
24029122,"More recently , stromal - related gene signatures have shown prognostic significance in AYA breast cancer , suggesting that differences in microenvironment may account for age - specific differences in breast cancer behavior."
24029122,"Although general principles for selecting cytotoxic and targeted agents are similar between AYAs and the general breast cancer population , endocrine therapy choices in the adjuvant and metastatic settings vary by pre - and postmenopausal status."
24029122,The role of ovarian suppression remains controversial and is reviewed.
24029122,"The AYA population is a unique group of patients who need individualized care , including considerations of hereditary breast cancer predispositions , future fertility , and the effect of therapy on immediate and long - term quality of life , all of which require coordinated multidisciplinary care."
24029122,"This article addresses the epidemiology , genetics , and management of breast cancer in AYA women and highlights unique medical issues important to this population."

24382432,Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation have been thoroughly evaluated in breast cancer.
24382432,New methods to detect epigenetic changes with higher specificity have been developed.
24382432,These methods are utilized to find new markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer.
24382432,"In addition , epigenetic modifications are assumed as new targets in the treatment of breast cancer and new drugs alone or in combination with conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or hormone treatment are being tested in clinical trials."
16555440,"Seen before as a secondary branch in the field of surgery , the surgery of breast cancer is now a fully stand - alone specialty."
16555440,"A number of factors explain this trend : a dramatic increase of incidence , which practically doubled during the past twenty years , an evolution of the surgical practices leading to a "" therapeutic coming - down "" and , above all , a complexification of indications and elements of classification."
16555440,"The surgeon still remains the first actor of the treatment , often seing the patient in first place , and having by his surgical treatment a key action on the prognosis and the patient 's quality of life."
16555440,"Nevertheless , the surgeon is not anymore the only master of the situation , as he once could have been."
16555440,Breast cancer is now the archetypal disease where a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory at every stage.
16555440,"The aim of this article is to overview the reality of breast cancer at present , trying to clarify the numerous elements of classification , otherwise confusing."
25355019,Purpose / objectives : To compare and contrast the molecular and environmental factors contributing to basal - like breast cancer and highlight the clinical implications for women with this phenotype.
25355019,"Data sources : CINAHL ® and PubMed databases , journals , and citation indices were searched using the key word basal - like in combination with breast cancer , epigenetic , treatment , subtype , risk factor , and BRCA1 to synthesize the literature on the multiple underpinnings of basal - like breast cancer."
25355019,Data synthesis : Research findings related to the molecular foundation of basal - like breast cancer were integrated with knowledge of nongenetic contributing risk factors.
25355019,Approved therapies and those under development were summarized with the goal of improving understanding for research and practice.
25355019,"Conclusions : Of the five subtypes of breast cancer , the basal - like subtype has the shortest survival and poorest prognosis."
25355019,The development of gene expression assays with epigenetic studies has enabled reliable identification of the basal - like subtype and has shed light on novel therapeutic possibilities.
25355019,"Clinical trials for basal - like breast cancer are underway , and the potential for individualized treatments for women with this subtype show promise."
25355019,"Implications for nursing : The main difficulties with basal - like breast cancer are its aggressive course , treatment refractory nature , and complex biology , all of which pose real challenges for clinical management and patient education."
25355019,Oncology nurses play a pivotal role in providing holistic care and patient support.
25355019,"Therefore , nurses must understand the complexity of the clinical presentation and the underlying biology of this cancer subtype."
24890450,"The management of breast cancer has evolved in the last 40 years to now encompass not only treating the cancer in the most effective way , but also to detect and treat cancers before they can pose a risk to patients."
24890450,This evolution in therapy and diagnostics has moved away from treating patients with the maximum amount of therapy they can tolerate towards a new paradigm where patents receive the minimum treatment to be most efficacious.
2031514,"Cure of breast cancer , strictly defined , is the elimination of hazard for death due to breast cancer."
2031514,Five - year survival is often incorrectly equated with cure.
2031514,"A review of the literature reveals ( a ) the relative survival for breast cancer maintains a negative slope for up to 30 + years , a sign of incurability ; ( b ) no more than 20 % of women diagnosed with breast cancer survive their disease and die of other causes ( personal cures )."
2031514,The incidence of breast cancer has been rising for over 50 years ; a rise in breast cancer mortality is possibly beginning.
2031514,Modest evidence for cure of breast cancer is largely based on the results of the Health Insurance Plan study.
2031514,Important methodologic problems of the study warrant cautions interpretation.
2031514,"When treatment expectations are maintained at a high level and there is no improvement and perhaps a worsening of mortality , the stage is set for a distressingly large volume of medical malpractice actions."
20414016,"Almost all breast cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy , hormone therapy , molecular targeted therapy , radiotherapy , and surgery alone or in combination."
20414016,It is reasonable and standard to choose a combination according to clinical practice guidelines.
20414016,One of the objectives of clinical practice guidelines is to standardize medical care and provide equal quality of care for patients wherever they live in Japan.

20358516,Treatment of breast cancer is complex and needs multidisciplinarity.
20358516,Preferably it should be performed in breast cancer units.
20358516,"Chemo - / endocrine treatment modalities are chosen by the targets ( eg hormone receptors , Her2 receptor ) and not by the risk any more ( bi-annual St. Galler Konsensus meeting )."
20358516,"The choice of local and systemic treatment should be adapted to the patient 's conditions ( age , co-morbidities , sometimes preferences ) and must strongly consider the risk of relapse."
20358516,"Treatment of breast cancer patients is demanding and requires knowledge and skills , both of which is best available in breast cancer units."
21680175,"It is interesting to assess the hitherto knowledge , on breast cancer in reproductive and young females , aged < 35."
21680175,"Even if breast cancer is rare in this group , it is , also physically and emotionally devastating."
21680175,"It is characterized by worse prognosis and outcome , in a stage of life , which is delicate for the female patients."
21680175,This rare subgroup of breast cancer patients is ought to be the center of investigation in future studies.
21680175,"This paper 's mail goal is to elucidate this entity , by presenting several aspects of the disease including risk factors , therapy , natural history and major differences between the groups of breast cancer patients and last but not least , the psychosocial features of this clinical entity , by reviewing the current and past medical literature till April 2011."
1933534,"As knowledge grows about breast cancer in men , it becomes apparent that the disease is strikingly similar to that seen in women."
1933534,"Although rare , as is cancer in most vestigial organs , all indications are that it shares a common etiology and a similar natural history with breast cancer in females and that apparent differences between the diseases in the two sexes are minor or illusory."
1933534,The poor prognosis of men in the past promises to yield to better public and professional education about the value of prompt recognition and treatment.
1933534,"Fortunately , the lessons learned from treatment of women are also applicable to men , and in comparable stages men prove equally curable."
6393393,"Depending on one 's viewpoint and appraisal of studies and statistics , breast cancer is viewed with optimism , pessimism , enthusiasm , or disappointment."
6393393,Each opinion is substantiated by ample data that support differing views.

21889719,Abundant clinical evidence suggests that androgens normally inhibit mammary epithelial proliferation and breast growth.
21889719,"Clinical and nonhuman primate studies support the notion that androgens inhibit mammary proliferation and , thus , may protect from breast cancer."
21889719,"On the other hand , administration of conventional estrogen treatment suppresses endogenous androgens and may , thus , enhance estrogenic breast stimulation and possibly breast cancer risk."
21889719,"Addition of testosterone to the usual hormone therapy regimen may diminish the estrogen / progestin increase in breast cancer risk , but the impact of this combined use on mammary gland homeostasis still needs evaluation."
32535765,"The development of radioisotope - independent , wire - free localization techniques for excision of non-palpable breast cancer will continue to expand rapidly within the next few years , increasing market competition."
32535765,"It is imperative that the introduction of these new technologies is correctly evaluated in terms of their major logistical benefits in streamlining pathways from radiology to the operating theatre and subsequent financial savings , rather than focusing upon margin re-excision rates - in which they are unlikely to advance current practice."
24735750,The incidence of breast cancer has increased rapidly in recent years and has now become the most common cancer in women in major cities of China.
24735750,"Here , we reviewed the history and progress of breast cancer research in China , including achievements that Chinese scientists have made in basic , translational and clinical research."
24735750,"Moreover , we evaluated the contributions of National Natural Science Foundation of China ( NSFC ) in the field of breast cancer research."
24735750,"The number of grants funded by the NSFC for breast cancer has tripled from 87 to 274 in the past 5 years , and this resulted in a dramatic increase in breast cancer publications."

10950215,"Approximately 180,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually , accounting for about 48,000 deaths per year in the United States."
10950215,The screening guidelines for the diagnosis of breast cancer are continually changing.
10950215,"Because of increased awareness of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and the use of screening mammograms , breast cancers are increasingly being diagnosed at earlier stages."
10950215,Annual mammograms and clinical breast examinations are recommended for women older than 40 years.
10950215,"Women older than 20 years should be encouraged to do monthly breast self - examinations , and women between 20 and 39 years of age should have a clinical breast examination every three years."
10950215,"These guidelines are modified for women with risk factors , particularly those with a strong family history of breast cancer."
10950215,Ultrasonographic studies are most useful to evaluate cystic breast masses.

17303514,"Data sources : Articles , abstracts , and practice guidelines."
17303514,Conclusion : Recent clinical trials have integrated the biology of breast cancer into individualized systemic therapy.
17303514,"Risk - adjusted treatment is driven by the addition of taxane therapy to systemic therapy , aromatase inhibitors , and trastuzumab into adjuvant therapy strategies."
17303514,"Implications for nursing practice : The decision to initiate systemic adjuvant therapy requires knowledge of risk of relapse , integration of evidence from clinical trials , and facilitation of patient decision - making."
27384952,"Women with a hereditary breast cancer predisposition have three management options : screening , chemoprevention ( risk - reducing medication ) and risk - reducing surgery."
27384952,"However , no randomized trials have addressed the effect of these strategies in mutation carriers."
27384952,"In the general population , randomized trials failed to demonstrate a benefit for screening in premenopausal women."
27384952,"Moreover , although chemoprevention reduces breast cancer incidence in high - risk populations , this benefit is potentially confined to estrogen receptor - positive tumors."
27384952,"Finally , observational studies suggest that prophylactic mastectomy and even prophylactic salpingo - ophorectomy reduces breast cancer risk in BRCA mutation carriers , but there are systematic biases associated with such studies."
27384952,"Therefore , women with a hereditary predisposition for breast cancer should be informed of the three risk - reducing strategies , and that their benefits are not fully understood."
15632248,"African - American women face a lower risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer as compared to Caucasian - American women , yet they paradoxically face an increased breast cancer mortality hazard."

20701440,"Currently , decision - making for breast cancer treatment in the clinical setting is mainly based on clinical data , histomorphological features of the tumor tissue and a few cancer biomarkers such as steroid hormone receptor status ( estrogen and progesterone receptors ) and oncoprotein HER2 status."
20701440,"Although various therapeutic options were introduced into the clinic in recent decades , with the objective of improving surgery , radiotherapy , biochemotherapy and chemotherapy , varying response of individual patients to certain types of therapy and therapy resistance is still a challenge in breast cancer care."
20701440,"Therefore , since breast cancer treatment should be based on individual features of the patient and her tumor , tailored therapy should be an option by integrating cancer biomarkers to define patients at risk and to reliably predict their course of the disease and / or response to cancer therapy."
20701440,"Recently , candidate - marker approaches and genome - wide transcriptomic and epigenetic screening of different breast cancer tissues and bodily fluids resulted in new promising biomarker panels , allowing breast cancer prognosis , prediction of therapy response and monitoring of therapy efficacy."

15019686,"In most but not all case - control and prospective cohort studies , an inverse relationship has been found between weight and breast cancer among premenopausal women."
15019686,"However , most large epidemiological studies have found that overweight or obese women are at increased risk of developing postmenopausal breast cancer."
15019686,It is suggested that higher body mass index is associated with a more advanced stage of breast cancer at diagnosis in terms of tumour size but data on lymph node status is not so consistent.
15019686,"All treatment modalities for breast cancer such as surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy and hormonal treatment may be adversely affected by the presence of obesity."
15019686,The overall and disease - free survival is worse in most but not all studies of prognosis of obese pre - and postmenopausal women with breast cancer.
29616377,"Purpose : Secretory breast cancer ( SBC ) is one of the rarest breast cancer ( BC ) , representing the majority of BC in childhood."
29616377,"Nevertheless , it elicits a lot of interest both for the peculiar morphology and the characteristic genetic features."
29616377,"Currently , there is no consensus on optimal treatment strategy."
29616377,"Therefore , it is useful to report every case in order to establish treatment algorithms."
29616377,"Methods : We describe the case of a 6 - year - old boy diagnosed with a SBC , with peculiar genomic and immunohistochemical features."
29616377,"Moreover , we carried out a review of the literature in order to analyze the present state of knowledge about this rare entity."
29616377,"Results : To the best of our knowledge , there are only 120 cases published in literature , only 32 in males and only 2 younger than 6 years."
29616377,"Furthermore , this one had peculiar genomic and immunohistochemical features."
29616377,"Indeed , even if SBC expresses basal - cell markers , our patient had a triple - negative tumor expressing both basal and luminal cell markers."
29616377,"Furthermore , the boy 's genomic profile revealed not only positivity for the typical SBC 's translocation t ( 12 ; 15 ) , but also for a 3q28 duplication , found in his father ( healthy ) and paternal grandfather ( with a previous BC )."
29616377,None were positive for BRCA mutation.
29616377,This locus includes only one gene encoding for a growth factor recently linked to Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy - 47 and Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia.
29616377,Even if the literature does not provide evidence of a pathogenic role it is not possible to exclude a cancer - predisposing activity.
29616377,"Conclusions : SBC is a rare type of BC , characterized by triple - negative features with an unexpectedly good prognosis."
29616377,More data are needed to fully understand the behavior of this cancer and genomic profiling could be helpful in improving its diagnosis and management.
2650720,The therapy of early breast cancer has been changing during the last decennium.
2650720,It requires a multi-disciplinary approach and in each of these disciplines improvements have been implemented.
2650720,The result is that treatment schedules can now be adapted to specific subgroups.
2650720,"In this review early breast cancer is defined as operable disease , using the critera set out by Haagensen."
2650720,"Emphasis is given to describing the new developments in prognostic criteria , since these form the basis for creating subgroups for specific treatment schedules."
2650720,Distinction is made between the factors relating to growth rate and those relating to metastatic potential.
2650720,Data on screening promises a beneficial effect of the implementation of screening in national health care programs.
2650720,"Important shifts are seen in treatment schedules ; the place of postoperative radiotherapy after classic ablative treatment is being challenged , whereas it plays a major role in the new breast conserving therapy schedules."
2650720,The data mentioned in the review suggest that a large proportion of ' operable ' cases can be treated with breast conservation but details in the technique of breast conserving therapy are still under investigation.
2650720,They form a major part of the coming prospective studies in breast cancer.
2650720,"Improvements in reconstruction techniques , creating better cosmetic results , make reconstruction more competitive with breast conserving therapy."
2650720,"The use of chemotherapy and endocrine manipulation in early breast cancer has now been clearly confirmed by the overview technique by the Peto - group , thanks to all efforts of individual trialists together."
8976406,Between 5 % and 10 % of breast cancer cases can be traced to primary genetic factors.
8976406,"Before the discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes , if a first - degree relative in direct genetic lineage had hereditary breast cancer or hereditary breast - ovarian cancer syndrome , the best estimate of family members ' genetic risk for breast cancer was 50 %."
8976406,Now the lifetime cancer destiny of a patient who carries a BRCA1 or BRCA2 germ line mutation can be determined with an extraordinary degree of precision.
8976406,"However , a major concern facing clinicians is how to use this powerful genetic knowledge without harming the patient."
8976406,This presentation focuses on the need for ( a ) compilation of a detailed family history of cancer of all anatomic sites ; ( b ) understanding of the natural history of hereditary breast cancer and its heterogeneous forms and the pathobiology of hereditary breast cancer ; and ( c ) preparation for performance of genetic counseling that is based on the results of DNA sequencing to detect genes related to cancer susceptibility.
8976406,"The discussion addresses the advantages of this molecular genetic movement , which include the abilities ( a ) to predict who is and who is not at inordinately high risk for cancer ; ( b ) to provide opportunities for highly targeted disease surveillance and management ; ( c ) to give patients the information they need to make appropriate long - term decisions about matters such as procreation ; and ( d ) to give genetic counselors the information they need to appreciate the emotions patients may encounter , such as fear , anxiety , and apprehension , and the ordeal of being subjected to discrimination by insurance companies and employers."
19726557,"In breast cancer , different situations call for different imaging tests."
19726557,Mammography is the test of choice for screening women with no signs or symptoms of breast cancer.
19726557,"For diagnosis , tailored mammographic views and ultrasonography are the norm."
19726557,"Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) is highly sensitive for cancer staging , problem - solving , posttreatment surveillance , and other indications."
19726557,It can detect primary breast cancers and additional foci of cancer that are occult to standard imaging.
19726557,Continued improvements in technology and studies to assess outcomes will help to better define MRI 's role in breast cancer.
17081753,Nationwide breast cancer screening with mammography is well - established in many western countries.
17081753,Many studies have shown its benefit in mortality reduction.
17081753,"However , breast cancer screening in Asia has been slow to implement , as it was perceived that the breast cancer incidence was low and the parenchyma of Asian women was difficult to assess mammographically."
17081753,"With changing disease patterns , breast cancer is now one of the most common cancers amongst women in Asia."
17081753,Breast cancer screening has become an important and relevant health problem.
17081753,"However , apart from biological differences between western and Asian women , cultural and economic considerations need to be addressed."
17081753,This paper looks at the various issues pertaining to the feasibility and relevance of population - based screening in the Asia / Pacific region.
21764517,Breast cancer is not a single disease.
21764517,Genetic array tools can define several subtypes.
21764517,Specific biological processes and distinct gene pathways are associated with prognosis and sensitivity to chemotherapy and targeted agents in different subtypes of breast cancers.
21764517,"As a consequence , breast cancer can be classified by molecular events."
21764517,"A primary challenge for future drug development in breast cancer will be to distinguish genes and pathways that "" drive "" cancer proliferation ( drivers ) from genes and pathways that have no role in the development of cancer ( passengers )."
21764517,The identification of functional pathways that are enriched for mutated genes will select sub-population of patients the will most likely be sensitive to biology driven targeted agents.
21764517,The selection of driver pathways in resistant tumors will permit to discover a biology - driven platform for new drug development to overcome resistance.
21764517,Any of the breast cancer subtypes implies that clinicians should consider cases within the various distinct sub-population in order to properly choose the most personalized therapeutic approach.
21764517,We will review all new emerging agents targeting the driver pathways within breast cancer molecular subtypes.
17920892,Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are well - established causes of hereditary breast cancer.
17920892,"As genetic testing becomes more widespread , increasing numbers of women are known to have mutations at or shortly after their breast cancer diagnosis."
17920892,Current evidence is insufficient to mandate different local or systemic treatment based upon the presence of a germline mutation.
17920892,The well - documented increased risk of contralateral second primary breast cancer and possibly of late ipsilateral second primary breast cancers may influence patient decision - making with regard to breast - conserving treatment.
10095683,"Psychosocial care , information - giving and issues surrounding patient choice are important aspects in the nursing care of women with breast cancer."
10095683,Patients with breast cancer consistently identify communication as an area of central importance.
10095683,"The nurse , specialist or otherwise , has an important role in addressing patients ' needs following diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer."
8610264,"Breast cancer is an uncommon disease in women under the age of 40 years , reportedly accounting for 7.5 % of reported cases."
8610264,"Delay in diagnosis is attributable to a clinically low index of suspicion , difficulty in examining dense and nodular breasts in younger women , and less frequently performed screening mammography."
8610264,Genetic mutations should be suspected in women with breast cancer who are under the age of 30 years.
8610264,"In relation to older women , younger women have more adverse pathologic features and have a poorer prognosis."
8610264,"Younger age , per se , is not a contraindication to breast - conserving surgery."
8610264,"In node - negative young women , the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy need to be considered in relation to the short - and long - term risks of treatment."
8610264,A strong support system should be in place to deal with the adverse psychosocial impact of the disease.
8947910,The incidence of breast cancer has reached epidemic proportions in most Western developed countries.
8947910,The breast cancer rate is three times higher than in developing countries.
8947910,"In the USA alone , one in eight women will develop breast cancer during her lifetime."
8947910,Molecular medicine has allowed us to make great advances in understanding disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.
8947910,It has also let us forge inroads into the genetic screening of women who have a family history of breast cancer.
8947910,"However , women who have been classified as members of the high - risk groups have expectations of effective prevention or prophylactic therapy that can not , as yet , be delivered."
8947910,It is time to give serious consideration to the emerging prophylactic strategies that take advantage of the advances in molecular techniques in order to address this deficit.
23618694,"Breast cancer represents a heterogeneous group of diseases with varied presentation , morphological and biological features , behaviour , and response to therapy."
23618694,Management of breast cancer relies on availability of robust predictive and prognostic factors to support decision making.
23618694,"Identifying and validating the prognostic and predictive value of a given marker is based on studying its association with clinical outcome with or without consideration for therapy , respectively."
23618694,"In the field of cancer research , clinical outcome is determined by assessing certain time - dependent events : ' endpoints ' such as tumour progression , recurrence and patient mortality."
23618694,Guidelines for reporting tumour markers have been published and there is a perception that outcome determination in breast cancer is well documented.
23618694,"However , reviewing the literature has highlighted the varied use of definitions used in clinical outcome measures and there are pitfalls in outcome analysis."
23618694,This may have contributed to the discrepancies in the literature and to the inconsistent conclusions seen in published studies assessing the same markers.
23618694,Identification of these pitfalls is expected to improve prognostic and predictive marker assessment.
23618694,Here issues related to outcome determination in breast cancer including definitions and pitfalls and some critical views are presented.
27012127,A rapid increase in the incidence of breast cancer ( BC ) has been observed since the mid-20th century in Poland.
27012127,It is accompanied by a slower but steady increase in mortality.
27012127,BC is the most common malignancy in women in Poland and in the world.
27012127,"In 2012 , the reported 17,000 new cases of BC in Poland."
27012127,"The incidence of breast cancer increases , but significantly improves the prognosis of women in recent years."
27012127,5 - year survival is currently closer to 80 % in Poland.
27012127,Improving the prognosis is associated with two factors : the earlier detection and more effective cancer treatment.
27012127,Mammography screening increased the detection of cancer in the early stages.
27012127,"Thanks to the use of all methods of cancer treatment ( surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy ) resulted in a significant treatment effect."
27012127,BC has become a chronic disease.
10967790,Objectives : To provide a review of the major and minor risk factors for the development of breast cancer and the options for prevention and treatment in women at high risk for breast cancer.
10967790,Data sources : Clinical and research articles and textbooks.
10967790,Conclusions : Breast cancer is the leading cancer found in women in the United States.
10967790,"For high - risk women , understanding their risk , appropriate screening recommendations , and possible prevention strategies is paramount."
10967790,"Implications for nursing practice : Through education and psychosocial support , the nurse can assist with decision - making regarding risk reduction and current prevention and treatment options."
1775819,"Breast cancer in the male is an uncommon disease , occurring less than 1 % as often as in females."
1775819,"Because of its rarity , this disease has not been as extensively studied as its female counterpart."
1775819,Male breast cancer is evaluated and managed in a fashion very similar to that for female breast cancer.
1775819,Primary management in early stage disease is usually a modified radical mastectomy.
1775819,"First line hormonal therapy for metastatic disease , in our institution , is tamoxifen for patients with positive estrogen receptors."
1775819,Second line therapy consists of progestins or antiandrogens / LHRH analogs.
1775819,No firm recommendations can be made concerning adjuvant systemic therapy.
1775819,"However , it is likely that studies from female patients are adaptable."
1775819,"Unfortunately , carcinoma of the male breast is such an infrequently encountered tumor that unfamiliarity with the disease can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment."
1775819,An increased awareness of the disease may be expected to result in earlier detection and institution of therapy at a stage when cure may be possible.
23075236,"Despite the widespread use of mammography for breast cancer screening , breast cancer remains the most common cause of cancer - related mortality among women worldwide."
23075236,"The identification of biomarkers that identify cancers when they are small , localized and most treatable is an important aim of current breast cancer research."
23075236,"Biomarkers need to be sensitive , specific , reproducible and easily collected from patients from readily accessible tissue or body fluids."
23075236,"While conventional biomarker research has focused on soluble proteins , cell markers , proteomics and DNA methylation , much progress has also been made in the field of immunobiomarkers and multiparameter gene arrays."
23075236,"Currently , no one biomarker has demonstrated sufficient sensitivity and reproducibility for independent clinical and commercial use."
23075236,This review summarizes the current state of breast cancer biomarker research and anticipated future directions.
21853882,Breast cancer is the most frequent malignoma in female individuals : more than 10 out 100 females suffer from the disease.
21853882,The understanding of breast cancer as a primarily local disease has undergone a fundamental change in the last few decades.
21853882,"While throughout most of the previous century breast cancer was still mainly conceived of as a predominantly local disease , the radical nature of surgery can now be reduced to a minimum by the use of breast conserving procedures and axillary sentinel lymph node excision."
21853882,The systemic use of cytostatic and endocrine therapeutic modalities has simultaneously provided a major overall survival benefit for patients treated in accordance with current therapeutic standards.
21853882,"The multidisciplinary treatment challenge of breast cancer comprises nowadays surgery , systemic treatment and radiotherapy and aims to a more individualized therapy."
28292037,Breast cancer is most common in women and it is among the leading causes of cancer related deaths.
28292037,The curability of this type of tumor is increasing thanks to screening programs and treatment advances which have certainly enhanced patient survival.
28292037,"But challenges remain , particularly in respect of phenotypic instability of cancer cells."
28292037,The aim of this study was to analyse the phenotypic profile of breast cancer in patients treated at Mohammed VI Cancer Treatment Center over the years 2013 - 2014.
28292037,"We conducted a cross-sectional study over a two - year period , including the cases of breast cancer treated in our Center."
28292037,Data were collected from patients medical records and analyzed using Epi Info software.
28292037,1277 patients were treated in our Center.
28292037,"99.5 % were females , mean age 50.20 ± 11.34 years."
28292037,The most common histological type was invasive ductal carcinoma ( 80.7 % of cases ).
28292037,"It was diagnosed at an early stage ( 56,9 % )."
28292037,The most common molecular phenotype was luminal A ( 41.4 % of cases ).
28292037,"Luminal B , HER2 and triple negatives occurred in 10.4 % , 6.3 % , 11.2 % of cases respectively."
28292037,The study of tumor phenotype in patients with breast cancer helps clinician make treatment choice and policy makers implement programs against this disease.
18074245,Breast cancer is a rare disease in men representing nearly 1 % of the total breast cancer cases worldwide.
18074245,"While treatments developed for women with breast cancer are often applied to treat men with breast cancer , however , lack of awareness of this disease leads to its detection at a later stage in men."
18074245,This review discusses male breast cancer and draws comparisons with female breast cancer and discusses current treatments available to treat this disease.
18074245,It is believed that this review shall provide concise and relevant information increasing the awareness of issues revolving around male breast cancer ( MBC ).
17678765,The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in women has undergone profound changes in the past century.
17678765,"Although much research and clinical attention has been focused on saving the lives of women with this condition , less focus has been on rehabilitation aspects."
17678765,This postacute care should be a distinct phase of treatment.
17678765,The field of physical medicine and rehabilitation has much to offer women who undergo extremely toxic although life - prolonging therapies for breast cancer.
17678765,"The focus of rehabilitation should include improving strength and cardiovascular conditioning , alleviating pain and improving fatigue."
17678765,"With respect to exercise , this can help women to physically recover from treatment and potentially prevent cancer recurrence."
17678765,Many exciting opportunities will be available for rehabilitation specialists to improve the care of women with breast cancer and to participate in research in the field of oncology rehabilitation.
23915745,"As the population ages , oncologists will be faced with managing an exploding number of older patients with breast cancer."
23915745,"The primary challenge of caring for older cancer patients is providing treatment options that maximize long - term survival while accounting for comorbidities , life expectancy , and effects of treatment."
23915745,There is a paucity of data from trials on the risks and benefits of effective treatments in elderly breast cancer patients.
23915745,This article discusses how to evaluate older breast cancer patients and provides guidelines for optimal therapies in the adjuvant and metastatic treatment settings.
23879588,"Despite many recent advances , breast cancer remains a clinical challenge."
23879588,Current issues include improving prognostic evaluation and increasing therapeutic options for women whose tumors are refractory to current frontline therapies.
23879588,"Iron metabolism is frequently disrupted in breast cancer , and may offer an opportunity to address these challenges."
23879588,"Iron enhances breast tumor initiation , growth and metastases."
23879588,Iron may contribute to breast tumor initiation by promoting redox cycling of estrogen metabolites.
23879588,Up - regulation of iron import and down - regulation of iron export may enable breast cancer cells to acquire and retain excess iron.
23879588,Alterations in iron metabolism in macrophages and other cells of the tumor microenvironment may also foster breast tumor growth.
23879588,Expression of iron metabolic genes in breast tumors is predictive of breast cancer prognosis.
23879588,Iron chelators and other strategies designed to limit iron may have therapeutic value in breast cancer.
23879588,The dependence of breast cancer on iron presents rich opportunities for improved prognostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention.
24295492,The genetic alterations associated with breast carcinogenesis are well known.
24295492,On the contrary epigenetic alterations in hereditary breast cancer are a new field.
24295492,Two epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as the most critical players in transcriptional regulation in breast cancer : the methylation of DNA and microRNA interference.
24295492,In this review we will focus on recent findings on gene silencing caused by DNA methylation and microRNA to explore the potential role of these epigenetic changes in the understanding of hereditary breast cancer.
24295492,"Moreover we will describe the same alterations in basal - like breast cancer and in triple - negative breast cancer , since their phenotypes have similarities with BRCA1 - mutated tumors."
24295492,"To underline the possibility that some epigenetic alterations could also be used as potential epigenetic biomarkers of drug sensitivity or resistance , we will discuss the more common therapies in hereditary breast cancer that could also be applied to breast cancer with basal - like or triple negative phenotypes."
25902604,"The incidence of breast cancer , currently one woman on eight , also concerns patients who underwent augmentation surgery."
25902604,"Breast implants have already been the subject of numerous publications concerning the risk of inducing breast cancer or of delaying its diagnosis ; however , no significant causal relationship has been established."
25902604,The purpose of this article is to assess the diagnostic and therapeutic consequences when breast cancer is identified in a patient with breast implants.
8827331,Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is the second ( after lung cancer ) leading cause of cancer deaths in women.
8827331,"Knowledge of breast cancer and its epidemlology , natural course , and response to treatment continue to evolve , making the survival rates for patients with breast cancer more optimistic."
8827331,"Women with breast cancer must decide , in partnership with expert physicians and nurses , what their options are for screening , diagnosis , and treatment."
8827331,This article provides an overview of options available to women diagnosed with breast cancer.
24131971,"The diagnostic and local treatment modalities of hereditary breast cancer ( HBC ) are evolving based on emerging evidence from new imaging , radiotherapy and surgical studies."
24131971,The optimal selection of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the individual HBC patient remains an area of active research in this relatively new patient population.
24131971,"In this context , some rational pathways of intervention are currently available to both reduce cancer risk in mutation carriers without a cancer diagnosis , as well as to reduce the risk of recurrence or new cancers among the carriers already diagnosed with a malignancy."
24131971,It is encouraging to notice to what degree certain interventions have successfully reduced both the risk of malignancy and the anxiety associated with this genetic diagnosis.
24131971,"This updated report aims at summarizing the most recent findings , while it identifies the areas of uncertainty that remain , and continue to present difficult challenges , particularly among younger HBC patients."
12861804,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK , with over 39,500 women diagnosed every year ( Cancer Research UK 2003 )."
12861804,"The author examines the biological , psychological and social aspects of managing patients with breast cancer."
12861804,This article also highlights the importance of the nurse 's role in supporting patients throughout their illness and in some cases at the end of life.
24382437,"In non-inflammatory locally advanced breast cancer , treatment typically includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy , surgery , and radiation therapy."
24382437,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy allows in vivo assessment of primary tumor response to chemotherapy and is achieved the early control of micrometastatic disease.
24382437,It also significantly improves surgical outcomes.
24382437,Patients achieving pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a better survival.
24382437,Tumor downsizing can make breast conserving therapy by - allowing for smaller resections and improving cosmesis.
24382437,Tumor downstaging with chemotherapy can allow breast conserving surgery in patients who are initially candidate for mastectomy.
24382437,Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an appropriate alternative to routine staging axillary dissection for early - stage breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillary nodes.
24382437,During the last years there have been a number of clinical studies on effectiveness and role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
24382437,The use of sentinel lymph node biopsy is an alternative approach to axillary dissection in patients with neoadjuvant therapy.
24382437,"In conclusion , patients with locally advanced breast cancer are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by breast conserving surgery with axillary dissection and radiation therapy as a part of the multimodality management."
16211226,"Breast cancer is a complex disease and different classifications , mostly based on clinical and pathological features , have been used for guiding the management of patients."
16211226,"Most of them fail to reflect breast cancer heterogeneity , which could be the reason why the treatment fails in approximately 30 % of cases."
16211226,Emerging molecular studies based on gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays have defined new molecular subtypes of breast cancer associated with the cell - of - origin distinction.
16211226,"Thus , breast cancer has been divided into five subgroups with distinct biological features and clinical outcomes."
16211226,We have tried here to confront the conventional existing classifications with this new molecular taxonomy.
16211226,It is likely that using all types of classification together will help in the management of breast cancer.
10363140,The multidisciplinary management of patients with locally advanced breast cancer ( LABC ) has evolved over the last three decades.
10363140,The introduction of chemotherapy ( CT ) and endocrine therapy in conjunction with surgery and radiation therapy ( XRT ) have changed the natural history of this disease.
10363140,"The authors discuss the role of the taxanes , novel endocrine therapy , and high - dose CT programs in the management of LABC."
10363140,Indications for breast - conserving surgery are presented.
10363140,The role of prognostic and predictive tumor markers in LABC is discussed.
16630739,Male breast cancer is an uncommon disease although its incidence has increased over the recent years.
16630739,"Like other orphan diseases , male breast cancer is understudied."
16630739,This disease has a lot of similarities with female breast cancer.
16630739,Some differences are yet noticeable.
16630739,This article describes three cases of carcinoma of the breast in men with a review of the literature on risk factors and treatment.
16630739,A database must be started with epidemiologic information to understand this disease and its correlation with breast cancer in women.
10550005,"Breast cancer remains the leading cause of death in American women 30 to 70 years of age , and research in the field of breast cancer continues at an explosive pace."
10550005,"Our understanding of the molecular basis of familial breast cancer has advanced significantly through investigation of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 , as has our knowledge of the role of the ATM gene and predisposition to breast cancer in ataxia - telangiectasia carriers."
10550005,"In addition , progress has been made in understanding the role of HER - 2 / neu as a prognostic factor in breast cancer."
10550005,"In this review , some of the recent advances in breast cancer biology that are relevant to these areas of study are highlighted."
8305544,"Major advances in the past year in the etiology , early detection , and prevention of breast cancer are reviewed."
8305544,Progress has been made in the genetic epidemiology of breast cancer.
8305544,"A major gene locus has been identified among cancer families with predominantly breast or ovarian cancer , or both."
8305544,Hormonal factors associated with breast cancer continue to be studied.
8305544,Recent reports suggested that exogenous hormone therapy is associated with only moderate or no excess risk of breast cancer.
8305544,"With respect to early detection , controversy arose regarding the benefit of screening for women younger than 50 years of age."
8305544,The Canadian National Breast Screening Study showed no decrease in breast cancer mortality for women 40 to 49 years old who were screened annually compared with women who had a baseline breast examination.
8305544,An international workshop was convened to review results of breast cancer screening trials with emphasis on women younger than 50 years of age.
8305544,Chemoprevention trials for the primary prevention of breast cancer are underway in North America and Europe.
8305544,Agents under investigation include tamoxifen and fenretinide.
8305544,"Prevention of breast cancer will also be examined in two trials with multiple disease end points ; one is an intervention with low dietary fat , and the other is an intervention with specific micronutrients."
10572545,"The natural history of breast cancer has not been fully elucidated , but physicians are making progress in the treatment of patients with this disease."
10572545,"Randomized , controlled trials indicate that screening , adjuvant systemic therapy , and adjuvant radiotherapy can reduce the risk for death caused by breast cancer."

27607596,"Lung cancer outcomes may be worse in HIV - infected persons in the antiretroviral era , but this may stem , in part , from treatment disparities."
27607596,"Early detection of lung cancer using chest computed tomography ( CT ) is being increasingly adopted for smokers in the general population , and recent studies suggest that it may be safe and efficacious in HIV - infected smokers."
27607596,Summary : Lung cancer is an important complication associated with chronic HIV infection.
27607596,"It is associated with unique HIV - related causal mechanisms , and may be associated with worse outcomes in some HIV - infected persons."
27607596,Smoking cessation and early cancer detection with chest CT are likely to benefit HIV - infected smokers.
17225705,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer - related death in the United States , with an average five - year survival rate of 15 percent."
17225705,Smoking remains the predominant risk factor for lung cancer.
17225705,"Lung cancers are categorized as small cell carcinoma or non-small cell carcinoma ( e.g. , adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , large cell carcinoma )."
17225705,These categories are used for treatment decisions and determining prognosis.
17225705,Signs and symptoms may vary depending on tumor type and extent of metastases.
17225705,"The diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected lung cancer includes tissue diagnosis ; a complete staging work - up , including evaluation of metastases ; and a functional patient evaluation."

17225705,Further evaluation for metastases depends on the clinical presentation.
17225705,Treatment and prognosis are closely tied to the type and stage of the tumor identified.
17225705,"For stages I through IIIA non-small cell carcinoma , surgical resection is preferred."
17225705,"Advanced non-small cell carcinoma is treated with a multimodality approach that may include radiotherapy , chemotherapy , and palliative care."
17225705,Chemotherapy ( combined with radiotherapy for limited disease ) is the mainstay of treatment for small cell carcinoma.
17225705,"No major organization recommends screening for early detection of lung cancer , although screening has interested researchers and physicians."
17225705,Smoking cessation remains the critical component of preventive primary care.
26667337,Lung cancer continues to be one of the most common causes of cancer death despite understanding the major cause of the disease : cigarette smoking.

23921082,"Risk factors for the development of lung cancer described include second - hand smoking , radon exposure , occupational exposure to carcinogens and to cooking oil fumes and indoor coal burning."
23921082,"Other factors reported are infections ( HPV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) , hormonal and diatery factors and diabetes mellitus."
23921082,Having an affected relative also increases the risk for lung cancer while recent studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with increased risk for lung cancer development in never smokers.
23921082,"Distinct clinical , pathology and molecular characteristics are observed in lung cancer in never smokers ; more frequently is observed in females and adenocarcinoma is the predominant histology while it has a different pattern of molecular alterations."
23921082,The purpose of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of this disease.
25627536,As a nursing student my knowledge of caring for patients with lung cancer had been rather limited.

29251665,Therapies with antibodies that block the interaction of PD - L1 with PD - 1 and thereby liberate an antitumor immune response have introduced a new era in cancer therapy with impressive therapeutic benefits.
29251665,"The high financial burden , treatment failures and therapeutic side effects of immunotherapies have prompted a search for biomarkers beyond PD - L1 expression , for example , tumor mutation load or immune cell profiling , that might more reliably identify patients that are likely to respond."
29251665,Summary : The discoveries of cancer research have been translated into the clinical management of lung cancer patients.
29251665,"So far , the approach of targeted therapy that is directed towards certain molecular alterations in a given tumor has been successful for adenocarcinomas , but not yet for squamous or small cell carcinomas."
29251665,Further clinical progress will require a better understanding of the molecular interactions within cancer cells that will subsequently enable innovative drug designs.
29251665,"Diagnostic molecular pathology will be a provider of information on a tumor 's features and thus , navigate precision cancer therapy."
28205188,Lung cancer has been linked to the changes in lung function characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and to the changes in lung morphology seen in emphysema.
28205188,It seems that a common thread of smoking - induced lung injury can be traced to all three diseases.
28205188,"However , the association is not as straightforward as it may seem ; for example , even never - smokers with emphysema have an increased risk of lung cancer."
28205188,"Whether lung cancer , COPD , and emphysema are linked by common genes , mechanisms , causes , or a combination thereof , understanding the associations between them has become a priority for research regarding tobacco - related illnesses."

15822487,"Since tobacco smoking is the cause in vast majority of cases , the incidence of lung cancer is expected to rise in those countries with high or rising incidence of tobacco smoking."
15822487,"Even though populations at risk of developing lung cancer are easily identified , mass screening for lung cancer is not supported by currently available evidence."
15822487,"In the case of non-small cell lung cancer , a cure may be possible with surgical resection followed by post-operative chemotherapy in those diagnosed at an early stage."
15822487,A small minority of patients who present with locally advanced disease may also benefit from pre-operative chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy to down stage the tumor to render it potentially operable.
15822487,"In a vast majority of patients , however , lung cancer presents at an advanced stage and a cure is not possible with currently available therapeutic strategies."
15822487,"Similarly , small cell lung cancer confined to one hemi - thorax may be curable with a combination of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation , if complete remission is achieved at the primary site."
15822487,"Small cell lung cancer that is spread beyond the confines of one hemi - thorax is , however , considered incurable."
15822487,"In this era of molecular targeted therapies , new agents are constantly undergoing pre-clinical and clinical testing with the aim of targeting the molecular pathways thought be involved in etiology and pathogenesis of lung cancer."

29800746,"In this analysis , we present and evaluate the argument that stigma is a highly significant barrier to fulfilling the clinical promise of advanced care and reduced lung cancer burden."
29800746,"This evaluation of the stigma of lung cancer is based on a multilevel perspective that incorporates the individual , persons in the individual 's immediate environment , the health care system , and the larger societal structure that shapes perceptions and decisions."
29800746,"We also consider current interventions and interventional needs within and across aspects of the lung cancer continuum , including prevention , screening , diagnosis , treatment , and survivorship."
29800746,"Current evidence suggests that stigma detrimentally affects psychosocial , communication , and behavioral outcomes over the entire lung cancer control continuum and across multiple levels."
29800746,"Interventional efforts to alleviate stigma in the context of lung cancer show promise , yet more work is needed to evaluate their impact."
29800746,"Understanding and addressing the multilevel role of stigma is a crucial area for future study to realize the full benefits offered by lung cancer prevention , control , and treatment."
29800746,"Coordinated , interdisciplinary , and well - conceptualized efforts have the potential to reduce the barrier of stigma in the context of lung cancer and facilitate demonstrable improvements in clinical care and quality of life."

18460729,Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in Iceland and the most frequent cause of cancer related deaths.
18460729,Smoking is by far the most important cause but familial factors also contribute.
18460729,"The symptoms of lung cancer are often subtle and the diagnosis , in about 70 % of cases , is made when metastases have occurred."
18460729,Curative surgical treatment is therefore only possible in about a third of the cases whereas other patients receive chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy.
18460729,In recent years some important advances have been made in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer.
18460729,New imaging techniques have improved diagnosis and staging practices and consequently also treatment.
18460729,Recent evidence suggests that screening with low dose CT may improve survival.

28956747,Lung cancer takes the leading place among the diseases being reported caused by CFs exposure.
28956747,"Molecular and biochemical studies have found that CFs exposure may lead to lung cancer by gene damage , formation of reactive oxygen species , blockage of related proteins ' function , and even cell death."
28956747,"However , reviews about the mechanisms of how CFs exposure leads to lung cancer are still lacking."
28956747,"Elucidation of the mechanisms of lung cancer caused by CFs exposure may provide a new insight into the prevention of lung cancer caused by CFs exposure , as well as laying the foundation for the toxicity study of CFs."
28956747,"In this minor review , the mechanisms of how CFs exposure leads to lung cancer were summarized and discussed."
29425790,"Lung cancer causes an estimated 1.6 million deaths each year , being the leading cause of cancer - related deaths in the world."
29425790,"Late diagnosis and , in some cases , the high aggressiveness of the tumour result in low overall five - year survival rates of 12 % among men and 7 % among women."
29425790,The cure is most likely in early - stage disease.
29425790,"The poor outcomes of treatment in lung cancer resulting from the fact that most cases are diagnosed in the advanced stage of the disease justify the implementation of an optimal lung cancer prevention in the form of smoking cessation and screening programmes that would offer a chance to detect early stages of the disease , while fitting within specific economic constraints."
29425790,"The National Lung Screening Trial ( NLST ) - the largest and most expensive randomised , clinical trial in the USA demonstrated a 20 % mortality rate reduction in patients who had undergone chest low - dose computed tomography ( LDCT ) screening , as compared to patients screened with a conventional chest X-ray."
29425790,Results of the NLST enabled the implementation of lung cancer screening programme among highrisk patients in the USA and parts of China.
29425790,"In 2017 , recommendations of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons also strongly recommend an implementation of a screening programme in the EU."
29425790,Further studies of improved lung cancer risk assessment scores and of effective molecular markers should intensify in order to reduce all potential harms to the high - risk group and to increase cost - effectiveness of the screening.
7534625,"During the 20th century , a dramatic epidemic of lung cancer deaths has occurred in many countries."
7534625,"The time trends of lung cancer incidence and mortality primarily reflect patterns of cigarette smoking , the predominant risk factor , but inconsistencies are evident in international comparisons."
7534625,"Although the predominant role of tobacco smoking as a cause of lung cancer throughout the world is amply documented , the persistence of tobacco smoking and the continued penetration of manufactured cigarettes into new markets provide a strong reason for continuing to monitor lung cancer trends."
7534625,Changes in other risk factors for lung cancer and changes in diagnostic and death certificate reporting practices may also affect trends in rates.
7534625,"However , our understanding of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer allows forecasting of lung cancer rates for public health planning."
31196372,"The morbidity and mortality of lung cancer is the first in the world , immunotherapy has become a important treatment strategy in addition to chemotherapy , radiotherapy and targeted therapy."
31196372,"In recent years , the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has successively approved immunological checkpoint inhibitors as standard programs for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in second - line or first - line treatment."
31196372,The National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) also recommends immunological checkpoint inhibitors as the standard treatment for small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ).
31196372,"Now , the treatment for lung cancer has entered the era of precision treatment , it is very important to select effective and reliable biomarker for the dominant populations of lung cancer to receive immunotherapy."
31196372,"A large number of researchs indicated that tumor mutation burden ( TMB ) may be an independent predicted biomarker for immunotherapy , but with limitations."
31196372,This article reviewed the predictive value of TMB and its limitations in the field of immunotherapy for lung cancer.
72894,Only patients with localized lung cancer benefit from curative resection.
72894,Curative radiotherapy is recommended in patients with a resectable tumor in whom surgery is precluded for medical reasons.
72894,Adjuvant preoperative or postoperative therapy of any type does not improve the results of surgery except in patients with Pancoast tumor.
72894,Therapy for nonlocalized tumors does not affect survival.
72894,Radiotherapy has a palliative effect in 50 to 75 per cent of patients presenting with symptoms from either a primary lesion or metastases and should therefore be recommended in symptomatic patients.
72894,The palliative effect of chemotherapy is limited in lung cancers other than small cell carcinomas.
72894,"However , chemotherapy alone or in association with radiotherapy produces remarkable tumor regression and some improvement of survival in small cell carcinoma."
72894,The use of immunotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer is still under evaluation.
25398122,Lung cancer is a common form of cancer.There are things you can do to lower your risk of lung cancer.
25398122,Stop smoking tobacco.

32213266,The worldwide epidemic of three coronaviruses and one influenza virus in 21st century have seriously threatened human health.
32213266,Infection with these viruses can cause respiratory symptoms.
32213266,The patients with lung cancer are more susceptible to viral infection and have a worse prognosis due to the advanced age and the systemic immunosuppressive state caused by malignancy itself and the anticancer treatments.
32213266,"In addition , without sufficient clinical awareness , a missed diagnosis of viral pneumonia may occur due to the fever and respiratory symptoms caused by lung cancer and its secondary diseases."
32213266,"Furthermore , control measures against viral outbreaks may interfere with routine diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients."
32213266,"Therefore , scientific protection and individualized management of lung cancer patients are particularly important during virus epidemic prevention and control."
32213266,"Here , we systematically reviewed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of viral pneumonia , its impact on patients with lung cancer and the differential diagnosis of lung cancer - related respiratory manifestations , aiming to provide guidance for the individual management of lung cancer patients during the prevention and control of viral pneumonia epidemic."
8724218,Female lung cancer death rates increased by more than 550 percent between 1950 and 1991.
8724218,In 1986 lung cancer surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States.
8724218,"The lung cancer epidemic is primarily attributable to cigarette smoking , which is responsible for at least 80 % of the disease in women."
8724218,"There are gender differences in the distribution of lung cancer by histologic type , even controlling for smoking , and some data suggest greater female than male susceptibility to lung cancer at a given level of smoking."
8724218,Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking women.
8724218,"Family history of lung cancer , personal history of lung disease ( e.g. asthma , chronic bronchitis , pneumonia , or tuberculosis ) , and a history of radiotherapy also appear to be associated with increased risk."
8724218,Data specific to women on the role of household radon exposures or of specific occupational or environmental exposures are relatively sparse and inconsistent.
8724218,"Finally , many studies have reported a decreased risk of lung cancer in individuals who consume high levels of fruits and vegetables ; however , clinical trials fail to support a beneficial effect of beta - carotene supplementation."
8724218,"Since cigarette smoking accounts for the vast majority of lung cancer cases in women , efforts to prevent adolescent girls from starting to smoke and to encourage cessation among established smokers have the greatest potential for reducing the female lung cancer burden."
31826745,The abscopal effect describes the ability of locally administered radiotherapy to induce systemic antitumor effects.
31826745,"Over the past 40 years , reports on the abscopal effect following conventional radiation have been relatively rare , especially in less immunogenic tumors such as lung cancer."
31826745,"However , with the continued development and use of immunotherapy , reports on the abscopal effect have become increasingly frequent during the last decade."
31826745,"Here , we present three illustrative case reports from our own institution and previous published cases of the abscopal effect in patients with non-small cell lung cancer , treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy."
31826745,We also present a concise review of the clinical and experimental literature on the abscopal effect in non-small cell lung cancer.
12403885,A series of review articles on lung cancer beginning in this issue of Thorax aims to increase the awareness of up to date evidence based knowledge and to generate further interest and optimism in its diagnosis and management.
31451145,The mortality rate of lung cancer has been high all over the world.
31451145,"In recent years , targeted drugs have become a new and effective method for the treatment of advanced lung cancer , but the early diagnosis and long - term effective treatment are still great challenges in lung cancer."
31451145,"Circular RNA ( circRNA ) is a unique RNA molecule with ring structure , which exhibits excellent stability and expression specificity."
31451145,Increasing studies found that the expression of several circRNAs in tumors were abnormal.
31451145,"This abnormal expression is not only related to malignancy of tumors , but also involved in regulating the progress of tumors , which provides a new way for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors."
31451145,"Therefore , this article reviews the expression , the diagnostic and prognostic value as well as pathogenesis of circRNAs in lung cancer in order to find new targets for early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer."
32429640,Young adult lung cancer is defined as a group of patients refers to whose onset age is less than 40 years old and ≥ 18 years old.
32429640,"Compare with elder lung cancer , the clinical symptoms of them are not typical , the stage is usually late at the time of discovery , and most of them have regional lymphatic metastasis or distant metastasis."
32429640,"Current study found that young adult lung cancer has a relatively unique genetic background , the abundance of tumor - driving genes is high , and it is closely related to its clinical manifestation and prognosis."
32429640,Young adult lung cancer is the focus of attention in the field of cancer in recent years.
32429640,"This article reviewed the literature on the clinical features , gene phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of young adult lung cancer in order to provide provide some references and clues for the study on young adult lung cancer."
21992731,Lung cancer in never smokers ( LCINS ) is the seventh leading cause of death among solid tumors.
21992731,"The main risk factor for lung cancer is smoking ; however , approximately 15 % of lung cancer patients have never smoked."
21992731,"LCINS is more frequent in women , irrespective of geographical location , nevertheless , the highest incidence has been found in South - East Asia."
21992731,The histological incidence of adenocarcinoma is higher in the group of never smokers than squamous cell carcinoma.
21992731,"There is a familial clustering of lung cancer that is more pronounced in never smokers , where the family history was associated with an increased risk."
21992731,Genome - wide association studies identified certain chromosomal aberrations in LCINS.
21992731,"Furthermore , the oncogenic mutation pattern is distinct in nonsmoking patients : activating mutations of EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase are more frequent."
21992731,"The etiology of LCINS includes several environmental factors as well , such as environmental tobacco smoke , viral and hormonal factors , a variety of pulmonary diseases and certain occupational exposures."
21992731,"It is now established that EGFR - tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment ( erlotinib and geftinib ) in lung cancer is more effective in LCINS , owing to the higher incidence of EGFR mutation in nonsmokers."
21992731,Despite the growing body of information on LCINS in recent years there is a need to further investigate the pathogenesis of this particular lung cancer.
21992731,"Future studies on LCINS should try to tackle the issues of prevention , early diagnosis and the exploration of novel therapeutic targets to combat lung cancer disease."
25901560,European studies have contributed significantly to the understanding of lung cancer screening.
25901560,"Smoking within screening , quality of life , nodule management , minimally invasive treatments , cancer prevention programs , and risk models have been extensively investigated by European groups."
25901560,"Mortality data from European screening studies have not been encouraging so far , but long - term results of the NELSON study are eagerly awaited."
25901560,Investigations on molecular markers of lung cancer are ongoing in Europe ; preliminary results suggest they may become an important screening tool in the future.
18922127,"In the early 1900s , lung cancer was a rare malignancy in women , but starting from the 1960s it has progressively reached epidemic proportions , surpassing breast cancer in 1987 and becoming the leading cause of cancer deaths in many countries."
18922127,"Retrospective data show that the 5 - year survival rate for women who have lung cancer is 15.6 % , compared with 12.5 % for men , and this improved survival could have important implications in the design and interpretation of lung cancer trials."
18922127,"Women have major responses to therapy regardless of stage , therapeutic modalities or histology."
18922127,"The increase of lung cancer incidence among women is reflected in their clinical trial participation , causing a survival improvement and suggesting the need of stratification by sex in future studies."
18922127,"No specific drugs for women with lung cancer are currently available , but researchers are devoting energies in this area in order to better understand the implication of gender differences in epidemiology , pathogenesis , prognosis and tumor response."
29066671,Lung cancer with a few to several metastases is so - called oligometastatic disease.
29066671,"Patient with recurrence only to limited site is also known as oligo - recurrence , and may be included as oligometastatic disease."
29066671,"From biological aspect , any existence of metastases is a sign of systemic disease."
29066671,"Due to the reports of long survival with only local treatment and without systemic disease in oligometastatic lung cancer , word of oligometastasis is used with fascinating expectation of cure to advanced lung cancer."
29066671,Most of the previous reports are retrospective and no comprehensive data exists for selecting patient for local treatment to oligometastasis.
29066671,Recent positive result of randomize phase II study is followed up with phase III study.
29066671,"Progress in treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with targeted therapy to oncogenic - driver ( EGFR , ALK , ROS1 and others ) and immune - checkpoint inhibitor ( PD - 1 pathway inhibitors ) makes it difficult to define the appropriate indication of local treatment to oligometastatic lung cancer."
21405971,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer - related mortality worldwide.
21405971,"Methods for early detection of lung cancer , such as computerized tomography scanning technology , often discover a large number of small lung nodules , posing a new problem to radiologists and chest physicians."
21405971,"The vast majority of these nodules will be benign , but there is currently no easy way to determine which nodules represent very early lung cancer."
21405971,"Adjuvant testing with PET imaging and nonsurgical biopsies has a low yield for these small indeterminate nodules , carries potential morbidity and is costly."
21405971,"Indeed , purely morphological criteria seem to be insufficient for distinguishing lung cancer from benign nodules at early stages with sufficient confidence , therefore false positives undergoing surgical resection frequently occur."
21405971,A molecular approach to the diagnosis of lung cancer through the analysis of exhaled breath could greatly improve the specificity of imaging procedures.
21405971,A biomarker - driven approach to signs or symptoms possibly due to lung cancer would represent a complementary tool aimed at ruling out ( with known error probability ) rather than diagnosing lung cancer.
21405971,Volatile and nonvolatile components of the breath are being studied as biomarkers of lung cancer.
21405971,Breath testing is noninvasive and potentially inexpensive.
21405971,"There is promise that an accurate lung cancer breath biomarker , capable of being applied clinically , will be developed in the near future."
21405971,"In this article , we summarize some of the rationale for breath biomarker development , review the published literature in this field and provide thoughts regarding future directions."
32283581,Resectable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is currently considered as a potentially curable disease.
32283581,"Surgery is still the main treatment mode for resectable NSCLC , but quite a few patients will have local recurrence and distant metastasis after surgery."
32283581,"Therefore , preoperative and postoperative adjuvant therapy may be necessary in order to improve the long term outcome."
32283581,Immunocheckpoint inhibitor has been demonstrated clinically to be effective andapproved as first - or second - line treatment agent in metastatic NSCLC or partially locally advanced NSCLC.
32283581,The remarkable efficacy of immunotherapy for advanced lung cancer has attracted more and more attention from the researchers to the role of immunotherapy as neoadjuvent therapy in resectable non-small cell lung cancer.
32283581,This article systematically reviewed the clinical trials of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for resectable NSCLC before surgery.
9251697,Lung cancer needs to be considered in patients with a history of cigarette smoking and / or symptoms such as haemoptysis or non-resolving cough.
9251697,"Radiological investigations are useful in staging , but a tissue diagnosis is necessary to confirm the presence of a tumour."
9251697,"Although early detection and referral are important to achieve the best chance of a cure , primary prevention by smoking cessation is the most important measure."
20187318,"Lung cancer in "" never - smokers "" constitutes only a small proportion of patients with lung cancer."
20187318,"Nevertheless , the topic has recently attracted a good deal of attention."
20187318,"Initially this was due to the fact that never - smokers with lung cancer had better outcomes with epidermal growth factor receptor - tyrosine kinase ( EGFR - TK ) inhibitors , compared to tobacco smokers with lung cancer."
20187318,More recently the identification of molecular changes unique to lung cancer in never - smokers has generated further interest in this disease.
20187318,"These findings have the potential to enhance our knowledge of lung cancer biology and lead to the development of new , more effective treatments for lung cancer."
20187318,"In this review , we summarize the existing body of knowledge on lung cancer in never - smokers."
25108403,Lung cancer is the most common and lethal malignancy in the world.
25108403,The landmark National lung screening trial ( NLST ) showed a 20 % relative reduction in mortality in high - risk individuals with screening low - dose computed tomography.
25108403,"However , the poor specificity and low prevalence of lung cancer in the NLST provide major limitations to its widespread use."
25108403,"Furthermore , a lung nodule on CT scan requires a nuanced and individualized approach towards management."
25108403,"In this regard , advances in high through - put technology ( molecular diagnostics , multi-gene chips , proteomics , and bronchoscopic techniques ) have led to discovery of lung cancer biomarkers that have shown potential to complement the current screening standards."
25108403,"Early detection of lung cancer can be achieved by analysis of biomarkers from tissue samples within the respiratory tract such as sputum , saliva , nasal / bronchial airway epithelial cells and exhaled breath condensate or through peripheral biofluids such as blood , serum and urine."
25108403,Autofluorescence bronchoscopy has been employed in research setting to identify pre-invasive lesions not identified on CT scan.
25108403,"Although these modalities are not yet commercially available in clinic setting , they will be available in the near future and clinicians who care for patients with lung cancer should be aware."
25108403,"In this review , we present up - to - date state of biomarker development , discuss their clinical relevance and predict their future role in lung cancer management."
24216523,"In the last 20 years , there has been an increased focus on gender differences in health and disease."
24216523,"The earliest studies of lung cancer enrolled mainly men , as the incidence of lung cancer among women was exceedingly low."
24216523,"As social patterns changed around World War II and women began to smoke more , the epidemiology of lung cancer has changed."
24216523,The higher percentage of lung cancer in nonsmoking women as compared with nonsmoking men suggests that lung cancer behaves differently in women.
24216523,"Studies of lung cancer in women indicate that there are differences in risk factors , histology , pathophysiology , treatment outcomes , and prognosis as compared with men."
24216523,"The purpose of this review is to provide a concise summary of the literature on lung cancer as it pertains to women , with an emphasis on new areas of research and treatment options."
18267181,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
18267181,Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 75 % to 80 % of all lung cancers.
18267181,"There is an impetus to find a screening test that can detect non-small cell lung cancer in its early preclinical stages , when surgical resection is most likely to reduce lung cancer mortality."
18267181,"Although earlier randomized controlled trials of lung cancer screening using chest radiography and sputum cytology failed to show reduced lung cancer mortality , CT is a much more sensitive test for detecting small lung nodules , and has generated considerable enthusiasm as a potential contemporary screening tool for lung cancer."
25906024,More and more women suffer from lung cancer.
25906024,In comparison to the male patients they are younger and more likely never - smokers.
25906024,Adenocarcinomas are more frequently in women than in men.
25906024,Their long - time survival post curative resection in early stage non-small-cell lung cancer is better than in men.
25906024,Women show frequently more molecular changes : more molecular targets are found.
25906024,Therefore they might benefit more from target - oriented stratified medical treatments.
25906024,"This overview comments on the gender - specific differences in diagnostics , treatment and outcome of lung cancer."
18222146,Objectives : There is expanding evidence that lung cancer has a multitude of sex differences.
18222146,This article will review these differences and discuss nursing implications for women with lung cancer.
18222146,Data sources : Research and journal articles.
18222146,Conclusion : Understanding the sex differences of lung cancer is essential for individualizing care for women with lung cancer.
18222146,Implications for nursing practice : Nurses play an integral role throughout the trajectory of illness for women with lung cancer.
18222146,Understanding the sex differences will help nurses to individualize the care for this population to meet their specific needs.
15209187,"Given that there is no validated test for early lung cancer detection , the current standard approach to lung cancer detection is to wait for signs or symptoms to develop."
15209187,"In that setting , newly detected lung cancer is generally rapidly fatal resulting in over 157,000 deaths annually."
15209187,"Sole dependence on tobacco control is an insufficient public health response to lung cancer , since most newly diagnosed individuals are either former smokers or never smokers."
15209187,Finding a more effective way to diagnose premetastatic lung cancer would be a crucial step toward an improved lung cancer - related mortality rate.
15209187,"Based on studies of breast cancer screening , we know that achieving optimal benefit from early cancer detection also involves defining the most effective , efficient , and safest approach to the clinical management of screen - identified lung cancer."
15209187,"In this review , we consider how to build on the successes of other cancer screening efforts to detect and manage early lung cancer."
15209187,"This involves outlining the specific elements for lung cancer that could make a screening program safe , affordable , and effective."
15209187,We also explore the current standards of early lung cancer management and target areas where potential pitfalls and opportunities for improvement exist.
29526181,"In recent years , series of driver genes , such as EGFR , KRAS / NRAS , BRAF , PIK3CA , ALK and ROS1 and so on , have been found in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) one after another with the development of molecular detecting technology."
29526181,Targeted drugs bring benefits for these NSCLC patients with driver gene variations.
29526181,"However , some NSCLC did not have any known driver gene variations ; we called it pan-negative lung cancer."
29526181,"In this paper , we summarize the concept , clinical pathological characteristics , the epidemiological characteristics , treatment and prognosis of pan-negative NSCLC."
16792198,"Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer diagnoses , sadly with a bad prognosis."
16792198,The main risk factor is smoking.
16792198,There are two major types of lung cancer : non-small cell lung cancer und small cell lung cancer.
16792198,The difference is important for prognosis and therapy.
16792198,The prognosis for patients with small - cell lung cancer is worse ; the treatment is based on chemotherapy.
16792198,In patients with non-small cell lung cancer surgery and radiotherapy are more important.
16880053,African Americans with lung cancer have disproportionately worse outcomes than other ethnic groups.
16880053,The incidence of lung cancer in blacks has remained well above the rates seen for the general population and the 5 - year and overall survival rates for blacks with lung cancer are among the lowest of all racial groups.
16880053,Many studies have focused on socioeconomic status of African Americans as the sole cause of these disparities.
16880053,"Other stu - dies , however , have identified additional factors related to risks for poor outcomes in blacks with lung cancer."
16880053,This article reviews data on these risks and their relationships to the health and health care of African Americans with lung cancer.
19223731,The main purpose of tumor classification is to distinguish clear differences such as deciding treatment or showing a peculiar characteristic.
19223731,"In the treatment of lung cancer , the standard for treatment selection is to make the important classification of small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) and non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC )."
19223731,"This is based on the fact that with a clinical - pathology difference and treatment reactivity , the prognosis differs between SCLC and NSCLC."
19223731,"In the 21st century , it has become insufficient to choose a treatment only by the classification of NSCLC with the advent of gefitinib a molecular target drug."
19223731,"Thus , treatment must be chosen in terms of the presence or absence of adenocarcinoma , an ethnic group , gender , a smoking history , and also the gene mutation."
19223731,"Moreover , it was reported by ASCO in 2008 that efficacy of pemetrexed is low for non-squamous cell carcinoma."
19223731,"From now on , not the NSCLC classification , but further detailed classification is needed to choose a treatment."
19223731,Treatment selection in terms of the individual will be possible with ongoing study.
22308553,This article aims to provide a brief review of the literature with regard to the impact of lung cancer on patients and their informal carers.
22308553,"Compared to other types of cancer , the distress associated with lung cancer has been found to be the most intense."
22308553,"Rather than focusing on symptoms in isolation recent emphasis regarding the symptom experience has been on symptoms clusters , as understanding these clusters may improve the management of ongoing and unrelieved symptoms."
22308553,"However , the disparities in methodology are significant barriers to producing comparable results , although recent efforts have been made to address these."
22308553,"Whilst research into symptoms has enormous potential for the management of symptom clusters , it needs to move away from the essentially reductionist stance which currently dominates and broaden its scope to one that acknowledges the complexity of the experience of symptom clusters from the perspective of the patient and their informal carer."
22308553,"Poor management of symptoms complicates patient care and potentially contributes to the heavy burden which often falls on family caregivers , especially as the disease progresses."
22308553,"The majority of studies focus on the experiences of primary care providers , most often the partner / spouse."
22308553,Such studies have shown that spouses of patients with lung cancer exhibit significant distress and lower levels of quality of life than the general population.
22308553,Research also indicates that significant others go through a transition process due to changes brought about by the diagnosis of lung cancer and struggle to endure and overcome difficulties and distress.
22308553,Significant others were seen to suffer during this process of transition and experienced altered relationships.
22308553,"Clinicians working with patients suffering from lung cancer and their carers should intervene to enhance their quality of life from diagnosis , during the disease trajectory and during bereavement."
22308553,Interventions need to be developed to support both patients and carers.
21986264,Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of mortality worldwide.
21986264,"According to recent estimates , 222,520 new cases of lung cancer ( non-small cell and small cell combined ) were diagnosed and 157,300 lung cancer - related deaths occurred in 2010 in the United States alone."
21986264,The two major histologic types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.
21986264,The diagnosis and management of lung cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach.
15099898,Accumulating data suggest that the risks for development of lung cancer are different in women compared with men.
15099898,"An increased susceptibility in women to the adverse effects of tobacco may be due to higher levels of DNA adducts , decreased DNA repair capacity , increased frequency of mutations in tumor suppressor genes , and hormonal differences."
15099898,"There are many sex and gender differences in lung cancer presentation , including a greater proportion of adenocarcinoma among women , a greater representation of women in cohorts of younger patients who have lung cancer , and women who do not smoke are more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than men."
15099898,"When guidelines for screening , preventive therapies , and treatment options for lung cancer are outlined these differences should be considered."
16002959,Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer - related death in both men and women in the United States.
16002959,Emerging evidence indicates that there are differences in the pathogenesis and possibly increased susceptibility to lung cancer in women.
16002959,"In addition , considerable data support small , but important differences favoring women in terms of response to therapy and long - term survival after the diagnosis of lung cancer , regardless of histology or stage."
16002959,These differences in both biology and outcome will be important considerations in the design of future trials of screening and therapy for lung cancer.
24639115,"According to the World Cancer Research Foundation , the newly diagnosed annual lung cancer cases all over the world are alarmingly high at 12.5 %."
24639115,It also shows the highest mortality rate among all the cancer types.
24639115,"Nearly 225,000 new lung cancer patients are reported annually in the USA."
24639115,The lung cancer cells also have very fast growth rates.
24639115,"As a result of this rapid proliferation rate , the lung cancer cells are sensitive to the available therapeutics like the radiation , surgical , or chemo therapy."
24639115,"Notwithstanding all the advances in the field of tumor biology , the mortality rate with lung cancer has remained significantly high."
24639115,Precise and early diagnosis of the disease can be an important step in the proper and successful setting up of the treatment modalities.
24639115,There are no comprehensive reviews available that discusses all the basic and updated aspects of lung cancer.
24639115,"This review focuses on the basic aspects of lung cancer like the etiology , risk factors , and clonal evolution."
24639115,Exposure to smoking comes up as a single major environmental cause of the disease.
24639115,The classification of lung cancer has also been discussed in detail based on immunohistochemistry.
24639115,The existing therapeutic approaches as well as the upcoming modern day interventions have been discussed with their pros and cons.
24639115,Recent techniques like molecular profiling can prove to be highly beneficial if properly standardized.
24639115,"With such advancements in therapy in conjunction with the updated diagnostics , there is a real hope in the treatment of lung cancer."
17117325,Lung cancer is becoming a real epidemic in developed countries and one of the main causes of cancer death in women.
17117325,"Although it is controversial to state , it is probable that women are more susceptible to lung cancer than men."
17117325,Molecular and genetic epidemiology studies are underway to prove this statement.
17117325,"Several biological factors , such as family history , histopathology , response to treatment and the prognosis for lung cancer in women have a bearing on the case."
17117325,"While these are not completely clear or consensual , there is a need for wide - ranging prospective studies which compare the differences between males and females."
17117325,"Until now , there has only been one area in which gender could impact on the therapeutic management of lung cancer : the role of gefitinib and erlotinib in inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptors , since these products are clearly of more benefit to female non-smokers."
17117325,"Given that women have a better lung cancer prognosis , it is recommended that future research protocols include stratification on gender."
17117325,Prevention of lung cancer in both women and men is a priority public health concern.
17117325,"A mandatory aim of this is the fight against smoking , the largest aetiological factor of lung cancer."
22540298,Context : Ongoing preclinical investigations and clinical trials involving new targeted therapies promise to improve survival for patients with lung cancer.
22540298,"Targeted therapeutic agents , based on genetic mutations and signaling pathways altered in lung cancer , have added significantly to our armamentarium for lung cancer treatment while minimizing drug toxicity."
22540298,"To date , 4 targeted therapies have been approved for treatment of lung cancer by the US Food and Drug Administration : gefitinib in 2002 , erlotinib in 2003 , bevacizumab in 2006 , and crizotinib in 2011."
22540298,"Objective : To review targeted therapies in lung cancer , the molecular biomarkers that identify patients likely to benefit from these targeted therapies , the basic molecular biology principles , selected molecular diagnostic techniques , and pathologic features correlated with molecular abnormalities in lung cancer."
22540298,To review new molecular abnormalities described in lung cancer that are predictive for response to novel promising targeted agents in various phases of clinical trials.
22540298,Data sources : Review of the literature covering the molecular abnormalities of lung cancer with a focus on the molecular diagnostics and targeted therapy.
22540298,Special emphasis is placed on summarizing evolving technologies useful in the diagnosis and characterization of lung cancer.
22540298,"Conclusions : Molecular testing of lung cancer expands the expertise of the pathologist , who will identify the tumor markers that are predictive of sensitivity or resistance to various targeted therapies and allow patients with cancer to be selected for highly effective and less toxic therapies."
23980680,Lung cancer is biologically aggressive and is the leading cause of cancer - related deaths.
23980680,"The development of lung cancer is unique in each patient according to clinical characterizations , prognosis , response and tolerance to treatment."
23980680,Traditional capillary - based single - gene sequencing by a first - generation technique ( known as Sanger sequencing ) has been replaced by next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) since it allows massive parallel sequencing with lower cost and higher throughput.
23980680,The NGS approach has made remarkable advances compared with traditional methods.
23980680,We expect these methodologies to comprehensively interpret the global landscape of cancer and provide more information to fulfill the needs of personalized medicine.
23980680,"This review covers a brief introduction and summary on various NGS technologies , applications and important findings by NGS in lung cancer advances , including further discoveries in previously known target genes ( EGFR , ALK and KRAS ) , the identification of additional lung cancer mutations and the global coordination of cancer genome studies."
18598932,"Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer - related mortality in the USA , and tobacco smoke is the major risk factor for this disease."
18598932,"However , many patients with lung cancer have never smoked ( never smokers )."
18598932,Patients with lung cancer who have never smoked are more likely to have mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase and have better response to its inhibitors than do patients with tobacco - associated lung cancer.
18598932,"Furthermore , the prevalences of mutations in KRAS and P53 differ for patients with lung cancer who have never smoked and those with tobacco - associated lung cancer."
18598932,Genetic mutations seem to be more common in patients with tobacco - associated lung cancer than in never smokers.
18598932,Current evidence indicates that the two types of lung cancer are biologically distinct.
18598932,"Here , we review published studies of the molecular genetics of lung cancer in never smokers and identify the specific differences from tobacco - associated lung cancer."
27732987,The lung cancer epidemic of the twentieth century grew out of increasing tobacco consumption in the first half of that century.
27732987,Tobacco control policies have been instituted in many high - income countries since the mid-1960s.
27732987,"Since then smoking rates have declined in these countries , particularly in men where lung cancer rates have stabilized."
27732987,"Tobacco control measures are not strong enough in many countries around the world , particularly low and middle income countries in Eastern Europe and Asia."
27732987,"In these countries , smoking rates and lung cancer rates remain high."
27732987,Tobacco cessation is more successful in countries with stronger tobacco control and confers quality of life and survival benefits in smokers including lung cancer patients.
27732987,"A significant degree of stigma surrounds the diagnosis of lung cancer which is often considered "" self - inflicted "" even though the tobacco industry promotes smoking uptake and maintenance."
27732987,"Sustained , effective tobacco control and cessation may improve lung cancer outcomes and are key considerations in modern care of lung cancer patients."
12517539,Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world.
12517539,"In men , the highest incidence rates are seen in Europe ( especially eastern Europe ) and North America."
12517539,"In women , high incidence rates are found in North America and in Europe , particularly in northern and western Europe."
12517539,It is estimated that there were about 375000 cases of lung cancer in Europe in 2000 ; 303000 in men and 72000 in women.
12517539,The number of resulting deaths was about 347000 ( 280000 in men and 67000 in women ).
12517539,Tobacco smoking is well established as the main cause of lung cancer and about 90 % of cases are thought to be tobacco related.
12517539,"There is a clear dose - response relation between lung - cancer risk and the number of cigarettes smoked per day , degree of inhalation , and age at initiation of smoking."
12517539,Someone who has smoked all their life has a lung - cancer risk 20 - 30 times greater than a non-smoker.
12517539,"However , risk of lung cancer decreases with time since smoking cessation."
12517539,"Recently , there has been renewed interest in screening because spiral computerised tomography can detect small asymptomatic lesions more effectively than conventional radiography."
12517539,"Although cure rates for such lesions are very good , there is to date no evidence for effectiveness of mass - screening strategies."
22810461,Early central airways lung cancer accounts for very small percentage of all lung cancers.
22810461,"Given this fact , it is much difficult to carry out a prospective randomized comparative clinical trial."
22810461,Even retrospective studies can offer important information.
22810461,Early central airways lung cancer is usually detected by sputum cytology.
22810461,"If sputum cytology shows atypical epithelial cells implying malignancy , the next thing we have to do is bronchoscopy."
22810461,Both autofluorescence bronchoscopy and white light bronchoscopy were superior to white light bronchoscopy alone in detecting this type of lung cancer.
22810461,Natural history of this cancer showed about the two - thirds of the patients die from original disease within 10 years.
22810461,"If the tumor length is 10 mm or less , photodynamic therapy is a first - line modality."
22810461,"After photodynamic therapy , a 5 - year overall survival of about 80 % and a 10 - year overall survival of 70 % can be expected."
22810461,"If a cancer does not meet the criteria for photodynamic therapy , surgical resection is recommended , and 5 - year overall survival of about 80 % can be expected."
22810461,Segmentectomy should be considered because of pulmonary function preservation if a tumor is located at segmental bronchi or beyond it.
22810461,The frequency of multicentricity is high.
22810461,Treatment strategy for subsequent primary lung cancer is an important key for the prognosis of patients with treated early central airways lung cancer.
22810461,"Surgical resection is still the most reliable treatment of subsequent primary lung cancer , except for in situ or microinvasive carcinoma located centrally , which could be cured by photodynamic therapy."
21734416,Immunochemistry is now an established ancillary technique in lung cancer diagnosis.
21734416,"Not only does it help in supporting the morphological diagnosis of malignancy , but its role now extends to the determination of cell lineage , ascertaining the primary site of tumour origin and contributing to decisions on prognosis and treatment."
21734416,Early detection and confirmation of lung cancer facilitate early treatment decisions.
21734416,Lung cancer management now has a multidisciplinary approach which includes cytopathologists and clinicians.
21734416,"Some clinicians may not understand what immunochemistry is and what its role is in lung cancer diagnosis , prognosis and therapy."
21734416,"The purpose of this paper is to define immunochemistry , on the background of basic respiratory airway epithelial structure and cancer biology , and discuss its application in the diagnosis , treatment and determination of prognosis of lung cancer."
10855253,There are few relationships in the epidemiology of cancer between an exposure and disease that are as consistent as those observed between tobacco and lung cancer.
10855253,"The health consequences of tobacco use are not limited to lung cancer ; the 1990 Surgeon General 's Report described that the use of cigarettes was the leading cause of avoidable mortality in the United States , with about 434,000 preventable deaths per year."
10855253,"Although a majority of the adults in the United States are current or former smokers , smoking cessation and prevention efforts have been successful , although currently about one in four adults still smoke cigarettes."
10855253,"The decline in ever - smoking has reached a plateau in the past few years , however , and rates of teenage smoking have begun to increase."
10855253,"In 1997 , smoking rates among high school students in the United States were 32 % higher compared with 1991."
10855253,"As noted by Cinciripini et al , adult smokers who quit or die are being replaced by children who smoke."
10855253,"Until recently , lung cancer control efforts primarily have focused on smoking prevention in youth and cessation among adults , with little obvious potential for reducing deaths through early detection."
10855253,"With the recent publication of early results from the Early Lung Cancer Action Project showing remarkably more favorable screening performance compared with chest radiography , the potential to detect lung cancer early and save lives is being revisited."
10855253,"Ultimately , the preferred disease control strategy is the prevention of lung cancer through the elimination of tobacco use altogether , but for the foreseeable future a legacy of decades of tobacco use in a significant proportion of the US population means we are still challenged to develop public health strategies to reduce deaths and suffering from those destined to develop lung cancer."
12450555,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in the United States.
12450555,The majority of lung cancer patients will present with advanced disease with a very poor overall survival.
12450555,"Although prior screening trials have shown no benefit from screening , there is renewed interest in low dose CT scanning as a screening modality for lung cancer."
12450555,A high proportion of screen - detected cancers are early stage and resectable for cure.
12450555,"For the majority of these early stage patients , standard lobectomy is the treatment of choice."
12450555,New options to potentially detect and treat early stage lung cancer will increase dramatically in the future.
24037999,Overestimation of the frequency and impact of over-diagnosis bias in lung cancer screening has contributed to long delays in implementation of lung cancer screening programs.
24037999,Literature review reveals little evidence of substantial numbers of over-diagnosed non-lethal lung cancer.
24037999,"There is now strong evidence that lung cancers that would not cause symptoms or kill during normal anticipated survival are uncommon and mostly limited to in situ adenocarcinomas , identifiable as CT non-solid nodules."
24037999,Prevention of overtreatment is possible within well - constructed diagnostic algorithms.
26706955,"In recent years , "" liquid biopsy "" received enormous attention as a new detecting method."
26706955,"As a non-invasive tumor screening method , the applications of liquid biopsy include early detection , monitoring relapse , assessment of therapy and molecule expression in lung cancer."
26706955,"The main source of liquid biopsy comes from circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) , ctDNA , and so on."
26706955,"This review will explore the biological characteristics , detection technologies and clinical applications of CTCs , ctDNA and other tumor markers in lung cancer and summarize liquid biopsy which in accord with three important criteria of high sensitivity ( high specificity ) , clinical utility and repeatability , especially a new method of ligand - targeted PCR ( LT - PCR ) that showed a high sensitivity of 67.2 % in stage I lung cancer."
26706955,"We expect that "" liquid biopsy "" could be really explored from scientific research to clinical application."
9555534,Lung cancer chemoprevention continued to make progress in 1997.
9555534,"The incidence of tobacco abuse continues to slowly fall in the United States , and paralleling it , lung cancer incidence."
9555534,Biomarkers of carcinogenesis and susceptibility continue to be an important area in identifying high - risk patients.
9555534,"The analyses of two major lung cancer prevention trials , beta - Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial ( CARET ) and Alpha - Tocopherol Beta - Carotene ( ATBC ) , were also published this past year."
9555534,Both found an increased incidence of lung cancer in individuals receiving beta - carotene.
9555534,"In both trials , heavy smokers seem to be the most adversely affected group."
9555534,The mechanism of this increased incidence of cancer and total deaths still eludes investigators.
2194622,Lung cancer has increased in importance as a cause of death over the last 60 years.
2194622,"It is now the commonest cancer in the UK , causing over 40,000 deaths per annum or an average of 110 per day."
2194622,"This review considers further aspects of epidemiology , aetiology and clinical features and discusses how we may better select the few who can be cured , so that the remainder receive more appropriate palliative therapy."
33113622,Lung cancer is by far the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in China.
33113622,"Through multidimensional discussion and analysis of disease , the multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) diagnosis and treatment brings lots of benefits for cancer patients , including increasing patient satisfaction , reducing hospitalization expense , shortening treatment waiting time , providing more reasonable diagnosis and treatment pathways and strategies , relieving medical disputes , increasing enrollment opportunities for patients in high - quality clinical trials , patients ' prognosis and life quality and so on."
33113622,"Presently , lung cancer MDT in China needs to be improved , including guideline following , democratic decision , landing performance and feedback , meeting records , patient follow - up and so on."
33113622,"So this consensus combines lung cancer MDT experience of China with leading - edge global oncology MDT experience to construct patient - centered lung cancer MDT diagnosis and treatment model , including MDT responsibility and obligations , organizational framework , working modality , standard procedures , assessment methods , and encouragement mechanisms and so on."
33113622,"Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group ; Chinese Society of Lung Cancer ; Lung Cancer Group of Oncology Branch , Chinese Medical Association ; Multidisciplinary Team Diagnosis and Treatment Committee , Chinses Medical Doctor Association jointly publish this consensus."
33113622,The purpose of this consensus is to provide procedures and criteria for lung cancer MDT of China.
26706954,Multiple primary lung cancer ( MPLC ) is an uncommon entity of the primary lung cancer.
26706954,"With the widespread use of early detection tools such as multislice spiral computed tomography ( CT ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , and the better survival results after resection of primary lung cancer , more and more MPLC have been detected."
26706954,"However , the current diagnostic and therapeutic methods can not meet the needs of MPLC individualized demand of diagnosis and treatment."
26706954,"At present , diagnostic criteria of MPLC are based on histological types , genetic characteristics , image features , tumor locations and clinical manifestation."
26706954,"On the treatment of MPLC , Surgery - based multi-discipline comprehensive treatment is regarded as the treatment of choice."
26706954,"In this paper , we make a review through summarizing the latest literature progress on the epidemiology , etiology , diagnostic criteria , treatment options and prognosis of MPLC."
23868001,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality rate worldwide , mainly because of the presence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis."
23868001,"Early detection of lung cancer improves prognosis , and towards this end , large screening trials in high - risk individuals have been conducted since the past century."
23868001,"Despite all efforts , the need for novel ( complementary ) lung cancer diagnostic and screening methods still exists."
23868001,"In this review , we focus on the assessment of lung cancer - related biomarkers in sputum in the past decennium."
23868001,"Besides cytology , mutation and microRNA analysis , special attention has been paid to DNA promoter hypermethylation , of which all available literature is summarised without time restriction."
23868001,A model is proposed to aid in the distinction between diagnostic and risk markers.
23868001,Research on the use of sputum for non-invasive detection of early - stage lung cancer has brought new insights and advanced molecular techniques.
23868001,The sputum shows a promising potential for routine diagnostic and possibly screening purposes.
26520187,Small - cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) comprises 13 - 20 % of all lung cancers but is the fifth leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
26520187,SCLC prognosis remains poor despite improvements in diagnosis and therapy over the last 30 years.
26520187,"Current treatment is systemic chemotherapy , flanked by thoracic irradiation for limited stage disease ; however , about two - thirds of patients are diagnosed with extensive stage disease when thoracic irradiation is not worthwhile."
26520187,"Randomized trials on surgical resection in patients with limited stage disease conducted in the pre-PET era , when both staging and treatment were inadequate , did not support a role for surgery in disease management."
26520187,"However recent retrospective and population - based studies indicate that outcomes after surgery in patients with very early SCLC are comparable to those in patients with non-SCLC , and that survival is better than in SCLC patients not given surgery."
26520187,"CT screening identifies SCLC at an earlier stage - with better survival - than usual care , and offers the hope that more SCLC patients may become long - term survivors."
26520187,"However , cases must be exhaustively staged to identify those likely to benefit from surgery."
26520187,Finding a specific SCLC marker to facilitate early diagnosis remains a priority.
15016317,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer - related death in the world.
15016317,"To understand the molecular processes and pathways of , and contributing factors to lung cancer progression , genetic alterations in various progression stages of lung cancer cells have been studied , since these alterations can be regarded as molecular footprints representing the individual processes of multistage lung carcinogenesis."
15016317,The results indicate that defects in both the p53 and RB / p16 pathways are essential for the malignant transformation of lung epithelial cells.
15016317,"Several other genes , such as K - ras , PTEN and MYO18B , are genetically altered less frequently than p53 and RB / p16 in lung cancer cells , suggesting that alterations in these genes are associated with further malignant progression or unique phenotypes in a subset of lung cancer cells."
15016317,"However , it is still unclear what genes control the metastatic potential of lung cancer cells."
15016317,"Further analyses of molecular footprints in lung cancer cells , in particular in the cells of metastatic sites , will give us valuable information to fully understand the process of lung cancer progression , and to find novel ways of controlling it."
15016317,Molecular footprints at the sites of p53 mutations and p16 deletions further indicate that DNA repair activities for G : C to T : A transversion and non-homologous end - joining of DNA double - strand breaks play important roles in the accumulation of genetic alterations in lung cancer cells.
15016317,"Thus , identification of environmental as well as genetic factors inducing or suppressing the occurrence of such alterations would be a clue to find novel ways of lung cancer prevention."
23194039,Lung cancer is the leading worldwide cause of cancer deaths.
23194039,Smoking is the dominant cause of lung cancer and smoking cessation is the established method to reduce lung cancer mortality.
23194039,"While lung cancer risk is reduced in former smokers , they have a lifelong increase in risk , compared to never - smokers."
23194039,"Novel chemoprevention strategies , such as oral or inhaled prostacyclin analogs , hold promise for these subjects."
23194039,Low - dose spiral computed tomography screening reduced lung cancer mortality by 20 % in high - risk heavy smokers older than 50 years.
23194039,"However , the high false - positive rate ( 96 % ) means that screened patients required controlled follow - up in experienced centers."
23194039,An increasing percentage of patients with advanced lung cancer have molecular drivers in genes for which oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed.
18823584,"Over a last decade , intense interest has been focused on biomarker discovery and their clinical uses."
18823584,This interest is accelerated by the completion of human genome project and the progress of techniques in proteomics.
18823584,"Especially , cancer biomarker discovery is eminent in this field due to its anticipated critical role in early diagnosis , therapy guidance , and prognosis monitoring of cancers."
18823584,"Among cancers , lung cancer , one of the top three major cancers , is the one showing the highest mortality because of failure in early diagnosis."
18823584,"Numerous potential DNA biomarkers such as hypermethylations of the promoters and mutations in K - ras , p53 , and protein biomarkers ; carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , CYFRA21 - 1 , plasma kallikrein B1 ( KLKB1 ) , Neuron - specific enolase , etc. have been discovered as lung cancer biomarkers."
18823584,"Despite extensive studies thus far , few are turned out to be useful in clinic."
18823584,"Even those used in clinic do not show enough sensitivity , specificity and reproducibility for general use."
18823584,"This review describes what the cancer biomarkers are for , various types of lung cancer biomarkers discovered at present and predicted future advance in lung cancer biomarker discovery with proteomics technology."
12692661,Purpose / objectives : To provide an overview of the biology of lung cancer with respect to genetic carcinogenesis and specific mutations and to discuss new therapies being developed to target lung cancer 's biologic processes.
12692661,"Data sources : Published articles , abstracts , book chapters , lectures , and personal experiences with experimental agents."
12692661,"Data synthesis : Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States , with minimal changes in the five - year survival rate during the past decade."
12692661,New understanding of the biologic process of lung cancer is providing potential new therapies that many hope will lead to increased survival for patients with lung cancer.
12692661,Conclusions : Exciting new therapies for lung cancer are being developed that target specific biologic processes of lung cancer.
12692661,"Implications for nursing : When nurses are familiar with the rationale behind biologic therapies , they can understand the drugs , assess toxicities , and help patients make educated decisions about therapeutic alternatives."
17084482,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer - related death in both men and women.
17084482,"Environmental carcinogens , particularly tobacco smoke , play a dominant role in the development of lung cancer , although 10 - 15 % of all patients diagnosed are non-smokers."
17084482,"In addition , emerging data demonstrate sex - specific differences in lung cancer susceptibility and prognosis."
17084482,"This implies that the development of lung cancer is modulated by complex interactions between genetic , hormonal , behavioral , and environmental factors."
17084482,"A better understanding of the differences between men and women and their impact on the prevention , diagnosis , and treatment of lung cancer requires continued basic and clinical research."
17084482,"Recent data on the epidemiological aspects of lung cancer in women , lung tumor biology , and emerging trends in clinical research were presented at a thought leaders ' roundtable hosted by the Society for Women 's Health Research."
17084482,"The panel concluded that as the patient population in lung cancer is changing from mostly male smokers to include women and non-smokers , an urgent need exists to increase awareness and research funding to improve lung cancer care , particularly in women."
17084482,"To further improve survival in this disease , both clinical characteristics and tumor biology should be considered in the development of new treatment options."
21438304,Lung cancer is the leading cause of tumour death and a large percentage of it is associated with tobacco smoking.
21438304,"Epidemiology has shown that asbestos cumulative exposures increase the risk of lung cancer to a variable extent , depending on the manufacturing process and the specific job."
21438304,The risk appears relatively small ( < or = 2 ) and is detectable after massive exposures only.
21438304,"Clinical diagnosis of asbestos - related lung cancer is based upon medical history ( exposures > 25 ff.ml years double the risk ) , possible lung fibrosis and counts of asbestos bodies and fibers in bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissues."
21438304,Pleural plaques do not correlate with the cumulative exposures that are associated with lung cancer.
21438304,"The multiplicative interaction between smoke and asbestos is only detectable when the risk associated with asbestos exposure is increased , i.e. after high exposures."
15961694,"A hundred years ago , lung cancer was a reportable disease , and it is now the commonest cause of death from cancer in both men and women in the developed world , and before long , will reach that level in the developing world as well."
15961694,The disease has no particular symptoms or signs for its detection at an early stage.
15961694,Most patients therefore present with advanced stage IIIB or IV disease.
15961694,Screening tests began in the 1950s with annual chest x-ray films and sputum cytology but they resulted in no improvement in overall mortality compared with control subjects.
15961694,The same question is now being asked of spiral low - dose computed tomographic scanning.
15961694,There have been big refinements in the staging classification of lung cancer and advances in stage identification using minimally invasive technology.
15961694,Postsurgical mortality has declined from the early days of the 1950s but 5 - year cure rates have only barely improved.
15961694,"The addition of chemotherapy to radical radiotherapy , together with novel radiotherapy techniques , is gradually improving the outcome for locally advanced , inoperable non-small cell lung cancer."
15961694,"Chemotherapy offers modest survival improvement for patients with non-small cell lung cancer , the modern agents being better tolerated resulting in an improved quality of life."
15961694,"The management of small cell lung cancer , which appeared so promising at the beginning of the 1970s , has hit a plateau with very little advance in outcome over the last 15 years."
15961694,"The most important and cost - effective management for lung cancer is smoking cessation , but for those with the disease , novel agents and treatment approaches are urgently needed."
8069599,"In recent years , the high incidence of lung cancer has made the disease one of the principal causes of death in human beings."
8069599,"The significance of cancer morbidity in China , which holds 1/4 of the population on the globe , is naturally an issue of concern to the health organizations all over the world."
8069599,"As the incidence of cancer tends to rise with every passing day , China is likely to follow the track of the industrialized countries , and lung cancer will top the list of incidence and cause of death of all cancers in urban areas."
8069599,"Presented in this paper are the epidemiology , pathogenesis , diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer in China , which is intended to promote mutual understanding and to facilitate cooperation and research , so as to upgrade the effective control of lung cancer."
22681927,Cancer - associated fibroblasts ( CAFs ) is fibroblast cells activated by cancer cells in tumor with myofibroblasts cells ( MFs ) properties.
22681927,CAFs is the main components of the tumor microenvironment.
22681927,Malignant conversion of CAFs phenotype is closely related to the tumor evolution.
22681927,"In this review , we summarized that : ( 1 ) The source of CAFs and morphology , and the relation between heterogenicity and the malignant phenotype conversion of CAFs with time - space change ; ( 2 ) The current research status and question of clinical application on CAFs ; ( 3 ) The relation of CAFs and invasion and metastasis of lung cancer ; ( 4 ) CAFs in the prognosis and treatment of lung cancer."
21541198,Targeting intracellular signaling molecules is an attractive approach for treatment of malignancies.
21541198,"In particular lung cancer has reached a plateau regarding overall survival , and target therapies could offer the possibility to improve patients ' outcome beyond cytotoxic activity."
21541198,"The goal for target therapies is to identify agents that target tumor - specific molecules , thus sparing normal tissues ; those molecules are called biomarkers , and their identification is recommended because it has a predictive value , for example , provides information on outcome with regard to a specific treatment."
21541198,The increased specificity should lead to decreased toxicity and better activity.
21541198,Herein we provide an update of the main target therapies in development or already available for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer.
11473242,"Lung cancer is the most common fatal malignancy in both men and women , both in the United States and elsewhere in the world."
11473242,"Today , lung cancer is most often diagnosed on the basis of symptoms of advanced disease or when chest x-rays are taken for a variety of purposes unrelated to lung cancer detection."
11473242,"Unfortunately , in the United States no society or governmental agency recommends screening , even for patients with high risks , such as smokers with airflow obstruction or people with occupational exposures , including asbestos."
11473242,"The origins of this negative attitude toward lung cancer screening are found in 3 studies sponsored by the National Cancer Institute in the mid-1970s and conducted at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , the Mayo Clinic , and the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Center."
11473242,These studies concluded that early identification of lung cancer through chest x-rays and cytologic diagnosis of sputum did not alter disease - specific mortality.
11473242,"However , patients with earlier stage disease were found through screening , which resulted in a higher resectability rate and improved survival in the screening group compared with a control group of patients receiving ordinary care."
11473242,"Patients in the control group often received annual chest x-rays during the course of this study , which was the standard of care at the time."
11473242,Thus no true nonscreening control group resulted.
11473242,The patients at highest risk were not enrolled in this study.
11473242,No specific amount of pack - years of smoking intensity was required.
11473242,Only men were screened.
11473242,The studies were inadequately powered to show an improvement in mortality rate of less than 50 %.
11473242,Ninety percent of lung cancer occurs in smokers.
11473242,"The prevalence of lung cancer is 4 to 6 times greater when smokers have airflow obstruction than with normal airflow , when all other background factors , including smoking history , occupational risk , and family history , are the same."
11473242,"Screening heavy smokers ( ie , > or = 30 pack - years ) with airflow obstruction ( forced expiratory volume in one second < 70 % of normal ) will yield 2 % or more patients with lung cancer ( prevalence cases ) and , over the course of 5 years , probably from 2 % to 3 % of patients with additional cancers , yielding an overall incidence of 5 %."
11473242,New technologies include low - dose helical computed tomographic scans for small peripheral adenocarcinomas that can not yet be visualized by standard chest x-rays and cytologic diagnosis of sputum for central squamous cell lesions.
11473242,These tests are complementary.
11473242,"A new health care initiative , the National Lung Health Education Program , recommends spirometric testing for all smokers 45 years or older , as well as for patients with symptoms of lung cancer."
11473242,Screening for lung cancer in such patients will find many cancers at an early stage when they are amenable to cure.
11473242,"Today , we have the knowledge and the technology that could change the outcome of lung cancer."
23496233,"MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are a class of endogenous small noncoding regulatory RNAs , which are new regulators of gene expression."
23496233,"They interfere with multiple biological processes involved in tumorigenesis such as cell proliferation , cell cycle , apoptosis , angiogenesis , invasion , and metastasis."
23496233,"A large body of evidence shows that the aberrant expression of miRNAs in cancer patients provides numerous underlying merits as diagnostic , clinical pathological , prognostic markers , and as promising therapeutic targets of lung cancer , providing an insight into the clinical application for lung cancer."
23496233,"Here , we focus on specific miRNAs as biomarkers in lung cancer and briefly introduce the biological function and modification of miRNAs."
31874543,"Lung cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in China , with 733 thousands estimated new lung cancer cases and 610 thousands deaths in 2015."
31874543,"In the pathological type of lung cancer , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) accounts for 80 % ~ 85 % , and 30 % of NSCLC patients have already reached stage Ⅲ at diagnosis , who have lost the optimal opportunity for surgical treatment."
31874543,"Stage Ⅲ NSCLC is highly heterogeneous , the 5 - year survival rates of stage ⅢA , ⅢB and ⅢC NSCLC are 36 % , 26 % and 13 % , respectively."
31874543,"For the great complexity of making decisions in the clinical practice of stage Ⅲ NSCLC , the experts of this consensus group combine the latest clinical research results and cutting - edge multidisciplinary concepts , conduct in - depth and detailed discussions on the hot issues and controversies in the diagnosis , treatment and follow - up surveillance of stage Ⅲ NSCLC."
31874543,Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Committee of Lung Cancer Society jointly publish this consensus to provide guidance for Chinese clinicians.
8965366,"The number of patients with early lung cancer , which is detected by screening high risk group for lung cancer using sputum cytology , or by screening using CT is increasing."
8965366,Recent studies have shown that some histologic types of early peripheral adenocarcinoma have no lymph node involvement.
8965366,"In addition , the incidence of multicentricity of peripheral type of early adenocarcinoma , detected by meticulous evaluation of CT images , is not so low."
8965366,Video - assisted limited resection may be feasible in such cases.
8965366,"In spite of the excellent results of surgical resection for the hilar type of early lung cancer , surgery is at risk in some patients because of underlying pulmonary dysfunction and of a high incidence of second primary lung cancers."
8965366,Endoscopic photodynamic therapy or brachytherapy may be an alternative to surgery as standard treatment in selected cases.
8324654,Lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer for both males and females in the United States.
8324654,"Left untreated , most patients die within one year of diagnosis with a median survival of less than six months."
8324654,Surgery remains the most effective method for controlling the primary tumor in most cases.
8324654,This article reviews the role of surgical treatment for the various stages of lung cancer.
14641911,Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer - related death in the western world.
14641911,"Its incidence is highly correlated with cigarette smoking , and about 10 % of long - term smokers will eventually be diagnosed with lung cancer , underscoring the need for strengthened anti-tobacco policies."
14641911,"Among the 10 % of patients who develop lung cancer without a smoking history , the environmental or inherited causes of lung cancer are usually unclear."
14641911,There is no validated screening method for lung cancer even in high - risk populations and the overall five - year survival has not changed significantly in the last 20 years.
14641911,"However , major progress has been made in the understanding of the disease and we are beginning to see this knowledge translated into the clinic."
14641911,"In this review , we will summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the cascade of events associated with lung cancer development."
14641911,"From subclinical DNA damage to overt invasive disease , the mechanisms leading to clinically and molecularly heterogeneous tumors are being unraveled."
14641911,"These lesions allow cells to escape the normal regulation of cell division , apoptosis and invasion."
14641911,"While all subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer have historically been treated the same , stage - for - stage , recent technological advances have allowed a better understanding of the molecular classification of the disease and provide hypotheses for molecular early detection and targeted therapeutic strategies."
22041044,"Historically , lung cancer has been viewed as a male disease , but during the past 50 years there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of lung cancer in women."
22041044,"Lung cancer is currently the most common cause of cancer death in American women , accounting for more than one quarter of all cancer deaths."
22041044,"This has been attributed to a significant increase in tobacco consumption by women ; however , approximately 1 in 5 women with lung cancer never smoked."
22041044,"As the incidence of lung cancer in women has increased , significant gender - based differences in epidemiology , biology , and treatment responses have become evident and warrant further investigation to advance the treatment of lung cancer in all patients."
30181359,"Despite the high long - term survival in localized prostate cancer , metastatic prostate cancer remains largely incurable even after intensive multimodal therapy."
30181359,The lethality of advanced disease is driven by the lack of therapeutic regimens capable of generating durable responses in the setting of extreme tumor heterogeneity on the genetic and cell biological levels.
30181359,"Here , we review available prostate cancer model systems , the prostate cancer genome atlas , cellular and functional heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment , tumor - intrinsic and tumor - extrinsic mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance , and technological advances focused on disease detection and management."
30181359,"These advances , along with an improved understanding of the adaptive responses to conventional cancer therapies , anti-androgen therapy , and immunotherapy , are catalyzing development of more effective therapeutic strategies for advanced disease."
30181359,"In particular , knowledge of the heterotypic interactions between and coevolution of cancer and host cells in the tumor microenvironment has illuminated novel therapeutic combinations with a strong potential for more durable therapeutic responses and eventual cures for advanced disease."
30181359,"Improved disease management will also benefit from artificial intelligence - based expert decision support systems for proper standard of care , prognostic determinant biomarkers to minimize overtreatment of localized disease , and new standards of care accelerated by next - generation adaptive clinical trials."
28255369,"Knowing the indolent , non-invasive nature of most types of prostate cancer , as well as the simple fact that the disease seems more likely to be associated with age rather than with other factors ( 50 % of men at the age of 50 and 80 % at the age of 80 have it [ 1 ] , with or without presenting any symptom ) , the big challenge of this clinical entity was to determine severity indicators ( so far insufficient ) to guide the physician towards an adequate attitude in the clinical setting."
28255369,The risk of over-diagnosing and over-treating many prostate cancer cases ( indicated by all the major European and American studies ) is real and poses many question marks.
28255369,The present paper was meant to deliver new research data and to reset the clinical approach in prostate cancer cases.
28895566,Genome sequencing and gene expression analyses of prostate tumours have highlighted the potential importance of genetic and epigenetic changes observed in WNT signalling pathway components in prostate tumours - particularly in the development of castration - resistant prostate cancer.
28895566,"WNT signalling is also important in the prostate tumour microenvironment , in which WNT proteins secreted by the tumour stroma promote resistance to therapy , and in prostate cancer stem or progenitor cells , in which WNT - β - catenin signals promote self - renewal or expansion."
28895566,"Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of inhibitors that target WNT receptor complexes at the cell membrane or that block the interaction of β - catenin with lymphoid enhancer - binding factor 1 and the androgen receptor , in preventing prostate cancer progression."
28895566,"Some WNT signalling inhibitors are in phase I trials , but they have yet to be tested in patients with prostate cancer."
29266472,"During the past decade , treatment strategies for patients with advanced prostate cancer involving stage IV ( T4N0M0 , N1M0 or M1 ) hormone - sensitive prostate cancer and recurrent prostate cancer after treatment with curative intent , as well as castration - resistant prostate cancer , have extensively evolved with the introduction and approval of several new agents including sipuleucel - T , radium - 223 , abiraterone , enzalutamide and cabazitaxel , all of which have shown significant improvement on overall survival."
29266472,The appropriate use of these agents and the proper sequencing of these agents are still not optimized.
29266472,The results of several recently reported randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies could assist in developing a treatment strategy for advanced prostate cancer.
29266472,"In addition , prospective studies and molecular characterization of tumors to address these issues are ongoing."
24840073,Approximately 15 % of patients with prostate cancer are diagnosed with high - risk disease.
24840073,"However , the current definitions of high - risk prostate cancer include a heterogeneous group of patients with a range of prognoses."
24840073,"Some have the potential to progress to a lethal phenotype that can be fatal , while others can be cured with treatment of the primary tumour alone."
24840073,The optimal management of this patient subgroup is evolving.
24840073,A refined classification scheme is needed to enable the early and accurate identification of high - risk disease so that more - effective treatment paradigms can be developed.
24840073,"We discuss several principles established from clinical trials , and highlight other questions that remain unanswered."
24840073,"This Review critically evaluates the existing literature focused on defining the high - risk population , the management of patients with high - risk prostate cancer , and future directions to optimize care."
30345007,"Advanced prostate cancer includes a wide spectrum of disease ranging from hormone naïve or hormone sensitive to castration resistant , both containing populations of men who have demonstrable metastatic and non-metastatic states."
30345007,The mainstay of treatment for metastatic hormone - sensitive prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ).
30345007,"However , recent level 1 evidence demonstrates that the addition of chemotherapy or abiraterone acetate to ADT results in significant survival advantage as compared with ADT alone."
30345007,"Furthermore , in non-metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer ( M0 CRPC ) , two second - generation anti-androgens , apalutamide and enzalutamide , when used in combination with ADT , have demonstrated a significant benefit in metastasis - free survival."
30345007,"Here , we review the most recent studies leading to these significant changes in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer."
27986209,"Prostate cancer rates vary substantially by race , ethnicity , and geography."
27986209,"These disparities can be explained by variation in access to screening and treatment , variation in exposure to prostate cancer risk factors , and variation in the underlying biology of prostate carcinogenesis ( including genomic propensity of some groups to develop biologically aggressive disease )."
27986209,"It is clear that access to screening and access to treatment are critical influencing factors of prostate cancer rates ; yet , even among geographically diverse populations with similar access to care ( eg , low - and medium - income countries ) , African descent men have higher prostate cancer rates and poorer prognosis."
27986209,"To date , the proportion of prostate cancer that can be explained by environmental exposures is small , and the effect of these factors across different racial , ethnic , or geographical populations is poorly understood."
27986209,"In contrast , prostate cancer has one of the highest heritabilities of all major cancers."
27986209,"Numerous genetic susceptibility markers have been identified from family - based studies , candidate gene association studies , and genome - wide association studies."
27986209,"Some prostate cancer loci , including the risk loci found at chromosome 8q24 , have consistent effects in all groups studied to date."
27986209,"However , replication of many susceptibility loci across race , ethnicity , and geography remains limited , and additional studies in certain populations ( particularly in men of African descent ) are needed to better understand the underlying genetic basis of prostate cancer."
24384911,"The androgen receptor ( AR ) , ligand - induced transcription factor , is expressed in primary prostate cancer and in metastases."
24384911,"AR regulates multiple cellular events , proliferation , apoptosis , migration , invasion , and differentiation."
24384911,Its expression in prostate cancer cells is regulated by steroid and peptide hormones.
24384911,AR downregulation by various compounds which are contained in fruits and vegetables is considered a chemopreventive strategy for prostate cancer.
24384911,"There is a bidirectional interaction between the AR and micro-RNA ( miRNA ) in prostate cancer ; androgens may upregulate or downregulate the selected miRNA , whereas the AR itself is a target of miRNA."
24384911,"AR mutations have been discovered in prostate cancer , and their incidence may increase with tumor progression."
24384911,AR mutations and increased expression of selected coactivators contribute to the acquisition of agonistic properties of anti-androgens.
24384911,Expression of some of the coactivators is enhanced during androgen ablation.
24384911,AR activity is regulated by peptides such as cytokines or growth factors which reduce the concentration of androgen required for maximal stimulation of the receptor.
24384911,"In prostate cancer , variant ARs which exhibit constitutive activity were detected."
24384911,Novel therapies which interfere with intracrine synthesis of androgens or inhibit nuclear translocation of the AR have been introduced in the clinic.
29580436,Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a variable natural history.
29580436,"Therefore , optimal management remains challenging."
29580436,"While many men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer may be candidates for active surveillance , there are others who will benefit from aggressive local therapy."
29580436,"Radical prostatectomy is associated with improvements in cancer - specific mortality , metastasis - free survival , and need for palliative treatments when compared with observation in several randomized controlled trials."
29580436,"Additionally , radical prostatectomy may have some oncologic benefit over radiation therapy."
29580436,All aggressive therapy for prostate cancer negatively impacts erectile function and urinary continence.
29580436,The decision for which treatment modality to pursue should incorporate shared decision making and consider cancer risk and severity in addition to patient preferences.
30521067,"The term "" oligometastatic prostate cancer "" refers to a heterogeneous group of disease states currently defined solely on the basis of clinical features."
30521067,"Oligorecurrent disease , de novo oligometastases , and oligoprogressive disease likely have unique biologic underpinnings and natural histories."
30521067,Evidence suggesting the existence of a subset of patients who harbor prostate cancer with limited metastatic potential currently includes disparate and overwhelmingly retrospective reports.
30521067,"Nevertheless , emerging prospective data have corroborated the "" better - than - expected , "" retrospectively observed outcomes , particularly in the setting of oligorecurrent prostate cancer."
30521067,Improved functional imaging with prostate - specific membrane antigen - targeted strategies may enhance the identification of patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer in the short term.
30521067,"In the long term , refinement of the oligometastatic case definition likely will require biologic risk - stratification schemes."
30521067,"To determine optimal treatment strategies and identify patients most likely to benefit from metastasis - directed therapy , future efforts should focus on conducting high - quality , prospective trials with much - needed molecular correlative studies."
30229546,"This chapter provides a brief overview of prostate cancer statistics , grading , diagnosis and treatment strategies that are discussed in more detail in the subsequent chapters of this book and the companion book titled "" Clinical Molecular and Diagnostic Imaging of Prostate Cancer and Treatment Strategies ""."
30229546,"It also points to websites that provide additional useful information for patients affected by prostate cancer and for students and teachers to obtain practical and updated information on research , new diagnostic modalities and new therapies including new updated clinical trials."
30229546,"Three sections are focused on overview of prostate cancer statistics ; overview of detection , diagnosis , stages and grading of prostate cancer ; and treatment possibilities and options."
27825428,Prostate cancer ( PC ) is a major disease that affects men 's health worldwide.
27825428,"It is the second most common form of cancer in men , surpassed only by nonmelanoma skin cancers such as basal and squamous cell carcinomas."
27825428,Diagnostic strategies with population screening for prostate cancer using prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) has been surrounded with controversy and debated intensively ever since the PSA protein was first purified in 1979 by Wang et al..
27825428,"At the same time , advances in diagnostic imaging , surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy have increased the opportunity to effectively diagnose , treat , and manage PC."
27825428,"Given the sheer burden of PC disease in Denmark and worldwide , new and innovative strategies for cancer diagnosis and care are needed."
27825428,This article is a short review of current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the care and management of prostate cancer in Denmark.
29198331,Current tendencies in the treatment course of prostate cancer patients increase the need for reliable biomarkers that help in decision - making in a challenging clinical setting.
29198331,"Within the last decade , several novel biomarkers have been introduced."
29198331,"In the following comprehensive review article , we focus on diagnostic ( PHI ® , 4K score , SelectMDx ® , ConfirmMDx ® , PCA3 , MiPS , ExoDX ® , mpMRI ) and prognostic ( OncotypeDX GPS ® , Prolaris ® , ProMark ® , DNA - ploidy , Decipher ® ) biomarkers that are in widespread clinical use and are supported by evidence."
29198331,"Hereby , we focus on multiple clinical situations in which innovative biomarkers may guide decision - making in prostate cancer therapy."
29198331,"In addition , we describe novel liquid biopsy approaches ( circulating tumor cells , cell - free DNA ) that have been described as predictive biomarkers in metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer and might support an individual patient - centred oncological approach in the nearer future."
31825540,"Introduction : The 2019 Coffey - Holden Prostate Cancer Academy ( CHPCA ) Meeting , "" Prostate Cancer Research : The Next Generation , "" was held 20 to 23 June , 2019 , in Los Angeles , California."
31825540,"Methods : The CHPCA Meeting is an annual conference held by the Prostate Cancer Foundation , that is uniquely structured to stimulate intense discussion surrounding topics most critical to accelerating prostate cancer research and the discovery of new life - extending treatments for patients."
31825540,The 7th Annual CHPCA Meeting was attended by 86 investigators and concentrated on many of the most promising new treatment opportunities and next - generation research technologies.
31825540,"Results : The topics of focus at the meeting included : new treatment strategies and novel agents for targeted therapies and precision medicine , new treatment strategies that may synergize with checkpoint immunotherapy , next - generation technologies that visualize tumor microenvironment ( TME ) and molecular pathology in situ , multi-omics and tumor heterogeneity using single cells , 3D and TME models , and the role of extracellular vesicles in cancer and their potential as biomarkers."
31825540,"Discussion : This meeting report provides a comprehensive summary of the talks and discussions held at the 2019 CHPCA Meeting , for the purpose of globally disseminating this knowledge and ultimately accelerating new treatments and diagnostics for patients with prostate cancer."
31825540,Keywords : artificial intelligence ; cancer immunotherapy ; precision medicine ; therapeutics ; tumor genomics.
30893147,Purpose of review : This overview examines the rationale for dietary interventions for prostate cancer by summarizing the current evidence base and biological mechanisms for the involvement of diet in disease incidence and progression.
30893147,Recent findings : Recent data have further solidified the association between insulin resistance and prostate cancer with the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance.
30893147,"Data also show that periprostatic adipocytes promote extracapsular extension of prostate cancer through chemokines , thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for the association observed between obesity and high - grade cancer."
30893147,"Regarding therapeutics , hyperinsulinemia may be the cause of resistance to phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase inhibitors in the treatment of prostate cancer , leading to new investigations combining these drugs with ketogenic diets."
30893147,"Summary : Given the recently available data regarding insulin resistance and adipokine influence on prostate cancer , dietary strategies targeting metabolic syndrome , diabetes , and obesity should be further explored."
30893147,"In macronutrient - focused therapies , low carbohydrate / ketogenic diets should be favored in such interventions because of their superior impact on weight loss and metabolic parameters and encouraging clinical data."
30893147,"Micronutrients , including the carotenoid lycopene which is found in highest concentrations in tomatoes , may also play a role in prostate cancer prevention and prognosis through complementary metabolic mechanisms."
30893147,"The interplay between genetics , diet , and prostate cancer is an area of emerging focus that might help optimize therapeutic dietary response in the future through personalization."
29633943,Prostate cancer is a disease that presents a wide spectrum from low aggressiveness localized to disseminated cancer.
29633943,Locally advanced prostate cancer ( LAPC ) is a particularly difficult to manage phase of this spectrum.
29633943,"Objectives : We review the definition , diagnosis and treatment of this phase of the disease."
29633943,Methods : We performed a non systematic literature review of the most relevant features of this pathology.
29633943,Results : LAPC is more aggressive than organ confined disease.
29633943,Its clinical diagnosis is not always easy.
29633943,"Local treatment , in spite of being aggressive with potential sequelae , seems to be advantageous in terms of patient survival."
29633943,Conclusions : Prostate cancer local staging is currently based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI ).
29633943,"Local radical treatment with surgery or radiotherapy , with probable addition of systemic treatment , offers promising results for disease control and quality of life improvement."
30684842,Oligometastatic prostate cancer represents an intermediate state between a localized tumor and widespread metastatic disease.
30684842,Its specific clinical features suggest the existence of a distinct biology which still needs to be elucidated.
30684842,"New imaging techniques like prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) PET scans have shown to perform well in the staging and restaging of this category of patients , at different phases of disease evolution."
30684842,"Despite limited prospective evidence , metastasis - directed therapies ( MDT ) are emerging as valid treatment options able to postpone systemic therapies and probably improve survival outcome."
30684842,The aim of this review is to shed light on the clinical scenario of prostate cancer patients with limited metastatic disease burden and highlight the role of MDT strategies in this setting.
28882782,"Objective : To critically analyze the available evidence regarding the incidence , etiopathogenesis , and management of prostate cancer ( CaP ) in transgender women."
28882782,"In addition , this article aims to present a recent case report of a transgender woman with a unique presentation at the author 's institution."
28882782,Materials and methods : An electronic nonsystematic literature search was performed to identify pertinent studies.
28882782,"PubMed search engine was queried by using the following search terms : "" prostate cancer , "" "" male to female transsexual , "" "" transgender patient , "" "" androgen + prostate cancer , "" "" estrogen therapy + prostate cancer , "" and "" health care barrier ."""
28882782,"In addition , a clinical case managed at our institution was reviewed and critically discussed."
28882782,"Results : Including our case , there have been only 10 documented cases of CaP in transgender women."
28882782,"Additionally , an emerging body of literature has questioned the role of androgens in the development of CaP and suggested that estrogen therapy may not be as protective as initially thought."
28882782,"Therefore , the current evidence suggests that the transgender woman should be screened for CaP the same as a nontransgender men."
28882782,"Barriers to care in the transgender female population include accessing resources , medical knowledge deficits , ethics of transition - related medical care , diagnosing vs pathologizing transgender patients , financial restrictions of the patient , and health system determinants."
28882782,"Conclusion : Although rare , CaP in transgender women has been documented."
28882782,Both the mechanism and the impact of receiving a bilateral orchiectomy on disease development are unclear.
28882782,"Future study is needed to examine these factors , and to further shape the treatment and screening regimen for these patients."
28597635,The treatment of prostate cancer with remote metastases has advanced greatly in recent years.
28597635,"Treatment options are dependent on the extent of the metastases , the patient ’s general condition and wishes , and the treatment response."
28597635,"We present an overview of the latest options for systemic treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer , based on availability in Norway."
31117038,"Updates to the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer include further refinements in taking a family history , new recommendations for germline and somatic testing , use of androgen receptor blockers for nonmetastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer , advice regarding intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation therapy , and consideration of whether to treat the primary tumor in men diagnosed with de novo metastatic prostate cancer."
29393241,Prostate cancer is a paradigm tumor model for heterogeneity in almost every sense.
29393241,"Its clinical , spatial , and morphological heterogeneity divided by the high - level molecular genetic diversity outline the complexity of this disease in the clinical and research settings."
29393241,"In this review , we summarize the main aspects of prostate cancer heterogeneity at different levels , with special attention given to the spatial heterogeneity within the prostate , and to the standard morphological heterogeneity , with respect to tumor grading and modern classifications."
29393241,"We also cover the complex issue of molecular genetic heterogeneity , discussing it in the context of the current evidence of the genetic characterization of prostate carcinoma ; the interpatient , intertumoral ( multifocal disease ) , and intratumoral heterogeneity ; tumor clonality ; and metastatic disease."
29393241,Clinical and research implications are summarized and serve to address the most pertinent problems stemming from the extreme heterogeneity of prostate cancer.
30324354,"Despite significant progress in early detection and improved treatment modalities prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in American men which results in about 30,000 deaths per year in the USA."
30324354,An aggressive phenotype leading to 2.58 % risk of dying from prostate cancer still exists and immunotherapy has offered new possibilities to treat metastatic prostate cancer that can not be treated by other modalities.
30324354,Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly growing field of research aimed at identifying biomarkers in immunodiagnosis and to develop new therapies by enabling the immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells.
30324354,"Immunotherapy falls into three different broad categories which are checkpoint inhibitors , cytokines , and vaccine immunotherapy."
30324354,While immunotherapy to treat prostate cancer is still limited progress has been made ; for treatment of advanced prostate cancer sipuleucel - T has been administered to patients in personalized doses to destroy prostate cancer cells which is promising and invites further research to determine immunotherapies for advanced prostate cancer.
30324354,Antibody - based targeted immunotherapy and dendritic - cell - based vaccination are among the therapies that are currently being evaluated as promising approaches to treat prostate cancer.
30324354,Combination immunotherapies include prostate cancer vaccines and radiotherapy for castration resistant prostate cancer.
30324354,"Microbial vectors for prostate cancer immunotherapy have been developed and bacterial strains have been engineered to express cancer - specific antigens , cytokines , and prodrug - converting cytokines."
30324354,These approaches are addressed in the present review.
26984216,"The population of patients with intermediate - risk prostate cancer are a large and heterogeneous group with highly variable prognoses , which present a challenge to efforts to develop standardized treatment recommendations."
26984216,New classification systems have been proposed that modify the existing National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and that subdivide men with intermediate - risk prostate cancer into favorable and unfavorable subgroups.
26984216,This review will examine the changing landscape of intermediate - risk prostate cancer and the effects on treatment decisions that may result from this new classification.
26984216,"The literature provides evidence that men with favorable intermediate - risk prostate cancer have prostate cancer - specific mortality and all - cause mortality rates similar to the rates in patients with low - risk prostate cancer and thus may be candidates for active surveillance , dose - escalated radiation therapy without short - term androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) , or , interestingly , standard - dose radiation therapy plus short - term ADT."
26984216,"Conversely , patients with unfavorable intermediate - risk prostate cancer have prostate cancer - specific mortality and all - cause mortality rates similar to the rates in patients with high - risk prostate cancer."
26984216,These patients would not be candidates for active surveillance and may in fact require long - term ADT in addition to standard - dose or dose - escalated radiation therapy instead of 4 to 6 months of ADT.
26728408,Key issues for prostate cancer patients are the detection of recurrent disease and the treatment of metastasized cancer.
26728408,Early detection is a major challenge for all conventional imaging modalities.
26728408,"Furthermore , therapy of patients with hormone - resistant tumor lesions presents a major clinical challenge."
26728408,"Because the prostate - specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) is frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer , several PSMA - targeting molecules are under development to detect and treat metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC )."
26728408,mCRPC represents a situation where cure is no longer achievable and novel therapeutic approaches for palliation and increase of survival are needed.
26728408,"In this article , we discuss the recent development for noninvasive detection of recurrent disease and therapy of mCRPC with corresponding PSMA - targeted radioligands."
32209821,Purpose of review : Summarize recent advances in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
32209821,Recent findings : Recent randomized data suggest a survival advantage to early use of novel androgen receptor inhibitors in combination with androgen deprivation therapy both in the setting of hormone - sensitive metastatic prostate cancer and nonmetastatic castration - resistant disease.
32209821,"While ongoing analyses examine optimal sequencing of existing agents for treatment of advanced prostate cancer , additional research focuses on expanding treatment options through development of novel genomically targeted therapies , antibody - drug conjugates , and immune therapy combinations."
32209821,"Summary : In this review , we summarize the recent data supporting the early use of novel androgen receptor inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer and aim to also frame how these drugs may fit within the existing context of docetaxel and abiraterone."
32209821,We present recent series examining sequencing of approved therapies while searching for predictive biomarkers.
32209821,"Finally , we examine trials evaluating novel agents that target certain biological pathways to highlight the likely future directions for progress in the clinical management of advanced prostate cancer."
30374010,"Endocrine therapy for prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy and antiandrogens , which are the standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer."
30374010,"Endocrine therapy is effective in most prostate cancers , but as treatment continues , most patients eventually experience resistant to endocrine therapy and disease progression."
30374010,Patients in this state are said to have castration - resistant prostate cancer.
30374010,"This review outlines the types of endocrine therapy for prostate cancer , the physiological mechanisms of endocrine therapy , its clinical use in Japan and the United States and Europe , new endocrine therapy for castration - resistant prostate cancer , and the side effects to be noted in endocrine therapy."
32139297,Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer - related death in American men.
32139297,"Antiandrogen therapies are part of the standard of therapeutic regimen for advanced or metastatic prostate cancers ; however , patients who receive these treatments are more likely to develop castration - resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) or neuroendocrine prostate cancer ( NEPC )."
32139297,"In the development of CRPC or NEPC , numerous genetic signaling pathways have been under preclinical investigations and in clinical trials."
32139297,"Accumulated evidence shows that DNA methylation , chromatin integrity , and accessibility for transcriptional regulation still play key roles in prostate cancer initiation and progression."
32139297,Better understanding of how epigenetic change regulates the progression of prostate cancer and the interaction between epigenetic and genetic modulators driving NEPC may help develop a better risk stratification and more effective treatment regimens for prostate cancer patients.
31466098,Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men.
31466098,Its incidence increases with age.
31466098,New treatment options have been introduced and there is a clear trend to more aggressive treatment in newly diagnosed metastatic disease.
31466098,"While prolonged survival of patients has been achieved , the new expensive drugs are associated with an increased burden on the healthcare system."
31466098,"Meanwhile , similarly to other tumour entities , there is a pool of different drugs available with comparable oncologic efficacy , but different side - effects."
31466098,"Effective diagnostic investigation and treatment decisions require additional factors , above and beyond clinical parameters , for a more individual treatment approach."
31466098,"In castration - resistant prostate cancer ( CRPCA ) , there are promising molecular markers for treatment decisions."
31466098,"In metastatic disease , liquid biopsies and next generation sequencing of metastatic biopsies allow for genetic analysis."
31466098,These will provide more insight into tumour dynamics and allow for patient selection.
31466098,This review concentrates on molecular markers in CRPCA.
30889622,"As a result of the growing incidence of cancer as well as increased survival of patients , an increasing number of people are living longer with cancer."
30889622,"In recent years , research has shown that physical activity not only protects against a number of cancer types , but is also valuable for patients undergoing cancer treatment and during the rehabilitation phase , as well as for improving function and quality of life."
30889622,"Regular physical activity is an effective way to reduce the side effects of cancer , resulting in part from physical inactivity and in part from the disease itself."
30889622,"Too much rest can lead to a decrease in aerobic fitness , strength , mobility and unwanted weight gain in the patient."
30889622,"In prostate cancer patients , hormonal treatment especially accelerates this process."
30889622,"In this paper we summarize the available evidence concerning the role of exercise in prostate cancer prevention , treatment and rehabilitation."
32558805,Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men after skin cancer.
32558805,"Owing to the rising popularity of prostate - specific antigen screening , large numbers of patients are receiving a diagnosis of prostate cancer and undergoing whole - gland treatment."
32558805,"Some patients with a diagnosis of low - risk , localized disease may not benefit from whole - gland treatment , however , given its known morbidity."
32558805,"In response to advances in prostate imaging and evidence suggesting that the prognosis in prostate cancer is related to the index lesion , many patients have begun to opt for focal therapy , which targets a lesion rather than the entire prostate."
32558805,"This "" middle ground "" of therapy , between active surveillance and whole - gland treatment , is appealing to patients because the risk for side effects is believed to be lower with focal therapy than with whole - gland treatment."
32558805,"This review discusses the oncologic rationale for focal therapy in localized prostate cancer , examines the major therapy modalities , and addresses future directions."
29961247,"Purpose of review : The role of testosterone in the development of prostate cancer and the safety of testosterone therapy ( TTh ) after prostate cancer treatment , or in the setting of active surveillance , remains controversial."
29961247,"There are many concerns about using TTh in men , particularly those with a history of prostate cancer , ranging from a possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease to cancer progression or recurrence."
29961247,"With many prostate cancer patients living longer , and hypogonadism having significant morbidity , much care must go into the decision to treat."
29961247,"Here , we review the literature investigating the effects of testosterone on the prostate as well as the efficacy and safety of exogenous testosterone in men with a history of prostate cancer."
29961247,"Recent findings : The improvement in quality of life with TTh is well studied and understood , while the argument for significantly increased risk of cancer or other adverse effects is much less robust."
29961247,"Neither increased rates of prostate cancer , cancer recurrence , or cardiovascular risk have been well established."
29961247,"In men with high - risk prostate cancer , evidence in the setting of TTh is very limited , and TTh should be used with caution."
29961247,The fears of TTh causing or worsening prostate cancer do not appear to be well supported by available data.
29961247,"Though more studies are needed to definitively determine the safety of TTh in men with prostate cancer , consideration should be given to treatment of hypogonadal men with a history of CaP."
30374609,The heterogeneity of prostate cancer has made imaging modalities of crucial importance in this disease.
30374609,"Accurate diagnosis and staging of the volume and extent of disease , especially in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer , can help to tailor the timing and modalities of treatment."
30374609,"While MRI has been effective in the detection of significant prostate cancer , its use in the identification and quantification of extraprostatic disease is limited."
30374609,This gap is now being filled by PSMA PET.
30374609,PSMA PET scans have now been shown to have a role in all stages in the prostate cancer journey.
30374609,"Emerging evidence has shown its promise in primary staging , restaging and theranostics."
30374609,"In this paper , we review the evidence for the use of PSMA PET in the various stages of prostate cancer , from initial diagnosis to advanced metastatic disease where other systemic treatments have failed."
28945566,Prostate cancer is a public health concern as it currently represents the most frequent malignancy in men in Europe.
28945566,Progression of this hormone - dependent cancer is driven by androgens.
28945566,"Thus , the most common treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer consists in an androgen ablation by castration therapy."
28945566,"However , the majority of patients relapses and develops a castration - resistant prostate cancer."
28945566,This failure of androgen deprivation is related to the emergence of mutant and splice variants of the androgen receptor.
28945566,"Indeed , androgen receptor variants are ligand - independent , constitutively active and thus able to induce resistance to castration."
28945566,This review focuses on AR variants signaling pathways and their role in resistance to castration and prostate cancer progression.
32462838,"For decades , androgen deprivation was the standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer."
32462838,"Chemotherapy , then novel anti-androgen therapies , changed the treatment paradigm."
32462838,"Large phase III randomized clinical trials were conducted over the course of the last decade , first among patients with castration resistant prostate cancer , then among those with hormone - sensitive disease."
32462838,"Today , androgen deprivation therapy alone is no longer the gold standard and should be associated either with chemotherapy in high - volume disease , or novel anti-androgen therapy."
32462838,"As such , each case should be discussed with a specialist to choose the most appropriate treatment."
28503903,"Introduction : The 23rd Annual Prostate Cancer Foundation ( PCF ) Scientific Retreat was convened October 27 - 29 , 2016 , in Carlsbad , CA."

28170061,Prostate cancer units - hubs in the future care of men with prostate cancer Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in Sweden.
28170061,"The past decade has seen a tremendous development of new methods for diagnosing , staging , treating and rehabilitating men with suspicious or confirmed prostate cancer."
28170061,This development necessitates a multidisciplinary and multiprofessional approach to the management of men with suspicious or confirmed prostate cancer.
28170061,A recent survey showed that currently few Swedish men with prostate cancer receive the quality of care that is outlined in the national clinical guidelines.
28170061,"Specialised prostate cancer units are increasingly common in Europe , but as yet there are no such units in Sweden."
28170061,"We believe that the creation of prostate cancer units in Sweden would be an essential step forward , towards an improved future care of men with prostate cancer."
21479346,"Prostate cancer continues to be a significant public health issue worldwide , particularly in countries where men have life expectancies long enough to clinically manifest the disease."
21479346,"In many countries , it remains one of the leading causes of cancer - related morbidity and mortality."
21479346,"Although significant progress has been made over the past few decades , many elements regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with prostate cancer remain enigmatic."
21479346,"In this Prostate Cancer special issue , our expert authors present and examine clinically relevant topics and look ahead to future research."
28095710,"Despite extensive clinical research of different chemotherapy agents for more than three decades , the role of chemotherapy in prostate cancer was only established in 2004 , after demonstrating a survival benefit with docetaxel in metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer."
28095710,"6 years later , second - line chemotherapy using cabazitaxel , after disease progression on docetaxel , demonstrated an additional survival improvement."
28095710,"Recently , docetaxel given alongside standard hormonal therapy in newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer was found to lead to significantly improved patient outcomes."
28095710,This article aims to cover the role of chemotherapy in prostate cancer and the latest developments.
31134920,Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in the reproductive system of older males.
31134920,Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) is an important treatment for prostate cancer patients.
31134920,"However , almost all prostate cancer patients unavoidably progress to the castration - resistant stage after ADT treatment."
31134920,"Recent studies have shown that tumor - associated immune cells play major roles in the initiation , progression , and metastasis of prostate cancer."
31134920,Various phenotypes of tumor - associated immune cells have tumor - promoting or antitumor functions mediated by interacting with tumor cells.
31134920,"Here , we review the current knowledge of tumor - associated immune cells in prostate cancer."
29860848,"Prostate cancer was the first cancer in which immunotherapy vaccine was approved by FDA in 2010 named Sipuleucel - T. No new immunotherapies have been approved since , as phase 3 trials did n't show any improvement in overall survival ( OS ) especially with immune checkpoint inhibitors."
29860848,"Currently tremendous amount of research is going on , in studying microenvironment of prostate cancer , finding new targets and biomarkers , and trying different combination therapies."
29860848,Some of the new targets explored are VISTA and PARP inhibitors.
29860848,Combination therapies have shown promising results in early phase trials and likely in near future we will have an effective immunotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.
29860848,In this article we will review the current data and future of immunotherapy in prostate cancer.
23773409,Background : HDR afterloading brachytherapy ( HDRBT ) for prostate cancer is now established as an effective technique to achieve dose escalation in the radical treatment of localized prostate cancer.
23773409,The previous guidelines published in 2005 from GEC ESTRO and EAU have been updated to reflect the current and emerging roles for HDRBT in prostate cancer.
23773409,Patients and method : The indications for HDRBT in dose escalation schedules with external beam are wide ranging with all patients having localized disease eligible for this technique.
23773409,Exclusion criteria are few encompassing patients medically unfit for the procedure and those with significant urinary outflow symptoms.
23773409,"Results : Recommendations for patient selection , treatment facility , implant technique , dose prescription and dosimetry reporting are given."
23773409,Conclusions : HDRBT in prostate cancer can be practiced effectively and safely within the context of these guidelines with the main indication being for dose escalation with external beam.
23773409,HDRBT used alone is currently under evaluation and its role in focal treatment and recurrence will be areas of future development.
28631917,This review summarizes current evidence of the etiology and diagnosis of prostate cancer.
28631917,"As before , a comprehensive urological examination remains the main method of diagnosing the disease."
28631917,"However , the invasive nature of the multicore prostate biopsy , its high cost and the need for specially trained personnel prompts to seek more state - of - the - art and non-invasive methods for diagnosing prostate cancer."
28631917,The further research in this direction seems promising.
31609776,"Purpose of review : The successful development of effective cancer immunotherapy , in particular immune checkpoint inhibitors , has changed the treatment paradigm of many tumor types."
31609776,"In light of the limited efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors demonstrated in recent clinical trials in refractory prostate cancer , this review highlights important recent and ongoing studies that are shaping the pursuit of effective immunotherapy for prostate cancer."
31609776,"Recent findings : We review two overarching themes with respect to recent studies of prostate cancer immunotherapy : evolving therapeutic strategies and novel biological findings , including the landscape of predictive biomarkers of immunotherapy response."
31609776,Summary : Novel and combinatorial immunotherapy strategies are being implemented across the clinical spectrum of prostate cancer.
31609776,"Greater understanding of complex tumor - immune interactions and the determinants of therapy response in prostate cancer is an area of intense investigation , and will inform both translational and clinical immuno - oncology research in the field."
26415820,In the United States of America male prostate cancer ( PCa ) is the most dominant malignancy and the second highest cause of cancer - related mortality risk compared to lung and colon cancers.
26415820,"MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are a class of endogenously expressed small , non-coding , single - stranded RNA which function as regulators of gene expression."
26415820,They influence various physiological and pathophysiological processes.
26415820,"In this review , we focus on the regulation of miRNAs in prostate cancer and their mechanisms which contribute to prostate carcinogenesis."
26415820,The relation of miRNAs with androgen signaling is highlighted and the prospects of miRNAs for clinical therapies are discussed.
30925537,Purpose of review : Summarizes the rapid progress being made in treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
30925537,Recent findings : Debate remains regarding the optimal sequencing of therapies in metastatic castration - sensitive prostate cancer with attention focused on the use of abiraterone versus docetaxel.
30925537,Randomized trials now show a potential advantage to next - generation antiandrogens in the setting of nonmetastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer.
30925537,"Patient - specific genomic anomalies , in particular DNA repair defects , provide targets for therapy with poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase inhibitors alone and in combination with other interventions."
30925537,Adjustments in the dose and administration schedule of the accompanying steroid may improve the efficacy of abiraterone.
30925537,Novel radiopharmaceuticals and immunotherapies suggest progress is on the horizon for men with castration - resistant prostate cancer.
30925537,"Summary : In this review , we will highlight the avenues of research leading to optimization of therapies for men with advanced prostate cancer."
30925537,"Known therapeutics , such as docetaxel and abiraterone , are being used earlier in the disease course in the setting of metastatic castration - sensitive prostate cancer , and next - generation antiandrogens in the setting of nonmetastatic castration - resistant disease."
30925537,"Existing interventions are being optimized , including a maneuver to salvage abiraterone response with steroid switch."
30925537,"Finally , individualized therapies directed at specific genomic aberrations , a radiopharmaceutical targeting prostate - specific membrane antigen , and immune therapy combinations are providing potentially additional treatment options for patients with refractory disease."
26593898,Cancer stem cells have been defined as cells within a tumor that possesses the capacity to self - renew and to cause the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise the tumor.
26593898,Experimental evidence showed that these highly tumorigenic cells might be responsible for initiation and progression of cancer into invasive and metastatic disease.
26593898,"Eradicating prostate cancer stem cells , the root of the problem , has been considered as a promising target in prostate cancer treatment to improve the prognosis for patients with advanced stages of the disease."
8290819,Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer deaths.
8290819,"New advances in screening and imaging allow earlier diagnosis , and improved surgical techniques have reduced sexual dysfunction and incontinence that often resulted from radical prostatectomy."
8290819,"However , many questions remain."
8290819,How can prostate cancer best be detected in an early curable form?
8290819,What is the role of tumor markers?
8290819,Who should be screened and how?
8290819,What prognostic tools can help with decisions about appropriate therapy?
28385455,The first results of the UK ProtecT study have been published.
28385455,"A total of 1643 men with localised prostate cancer were randomised between active monitoring , radical prostatectomy , and external - beam radiotherapy."
28385455,Comparisons between treatments showed no differences between surgery and radiotherapy in terms of cancer - specific survival and overall survival.
28385455,"Moreover , the patient - reported outcomes indicate that although the patterns of treatment - related side effects differ markedly according to the modality , neither surgery nor radiotherapy appears to be "" kinder "" overall."
28385455,"Conclusions from nonrandomised case series can be misleading , however carefully they are analysed , and this is particularly so for early prostate cancer."
28241429,The importance of long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) in the pathogenesis of various malignancies has been uncovered over the last few years.
28241429,Their dysregulation often contributes to or is a result of tumour progression.
28241429,"In prostate cancer , the most common malignancy in men , lncRNAs can promote castration resistance , cell proliferation , invasion , and metastatic spread."
28241429,"Expression patterns of lncRNAs often change during tumour progression ; their expression levels may constantly rise ( e.g. , HOX transcript antisense RNA , HOTAIR ) , or steadily decrease ( e.g. , downregulated RNA in cancer , DRAIC )."
28241429,"In prostate cancer , lncRNAs likewise have diagnostic ( e.g. , prostate cancer antigen 3 , PCA3 ) , prognostic ( e.g. , second chromosome locus associated with prostate - 1 , SChLAP1 ) , and predictive ( e.g. , metastasis - associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript - 1 , MALAT - 1 ) functions."
28241429,"Considering their dynamic role in prostate cancer , lncRNAs may also serve as therapeutic targets , helping to prevent development of castration resistance , maintain stable disease , and prohibit metastatic spread."
25219826,"Objectives : Though the external beam radiation therapy is a standard treatment option for both organ - confined and regionally advanced prostate cancer , unluckily , despite more and more effective advances in radiation delivery procedures , the prostate cancer radioresistance still occurs in a significant amount of patients undergone radiotherapy."
25219826,"This review aims to highlight the molecular aberrations of prostate cancer cell growth - and apoptosis signaling pathways that might induce , together with both prostate cancer cell / cancer stem cells gene - and surrounding microenvironment crucial implications , the tumor radioresistance."
25219826,Methods : An up - dated review of several thorough studies on such matter.
25219826,"Results : The plenty of intriguing knowledge acquisitions about the prostate cancer radioresistance depending on cancer cell growth / apoptosis signaling pathway - related molecular aberrations together with prostate cancer cell / cancer stem cell abnormal gene profile , may be the premise leading -- on the basis of preclinical research in animal models -- to clinically overcome the tumor radioresistance."
25219826,"Conclusions : Current developments of radiosensitizer agents focusly targeting prostate cancer cell radioresistance - associated specific molecular / gene aberrations are directed to improve , by implementing customized tumor radiosensitization modalities , the radiation therapy outcomes."
26977847,"Purpose of review : In recent clinical trials , immunotherapeutic agents have demonstrated promising results for the treatment of prostate cancer."
26977847,This review discusses emerging immunotherapies for prostate cancer and their evolving role in sequencing and combination therapy.
26977847,Recent findings : Therapeutic vaccines including PROSTVAC and DCVAC / PCa have completed promising phase 2 trials for the treatment of prostate cancer and phase 3 trials are underway.
26977847,"Recent evidence supports a synergistic relationship between immunotherapy agents themselves , antiandrogens and with cytotoxic chemotherapy."
26977847,"Prostate cancer patients with good prognostic factors , such as minimal disease burden , appear to achieve the optimal benefit from immunotherapy."
26977847,Summary : Therapeutic cancer vaccines and immunomodulating agents have demonstrated activity in the treatment of prostate cancer.
26977847,Immunotherapies may alter the prostate tumor microenvironment and ongoing studies aim to provide guidance on effective sequencing and combination strategies.
28910812,"Along with significant advances in prostate cancer biology research , we also observe the rapid development of modern diagnostic tests."
28910812,New biomarkers are derived to detect disease while it is organ - confined to stratify the risk and to aid clinical decision - making.
28910812,"Majority of these tools have already been validated clinically , but only a few have received premarket clearance and administration approval."
28910812,Superiority of novel tests is visible not only in improved detection accuracy but predominantly in the assessment of tumour aggressiveness and selection of patients eligible for conservative management.
28910812,Two factors limiting the clinical implementation of validated biomarker candidates are costs and local availability.
28910812,"For these reasons , currently , their true clinical role starts after routine screening with prostate - specific antigen test."
28910812,"With this review of prostate cancer biomarkers , we attempted to draw general conclusions on clinical perspectives of these novel tools."

28056257,"With the aging of the population , changes in diet and medical examination popular , the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in China are increasing year by year."
28056257,"Over the past year , a large number of clinical and basic researchers focus on various perspectives of prostate cancer , which may provide new direction for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer."
28056257,"In this paper , the near year important progress in the forefront of prostate cancer has been reviewed and summed up in two major aspects : diagnosis and treatment."
30278883,Genetic instability is one part of the oncogenic process.
30278883,Gene mutations involved in DNA repair mechanisms can promote this genetic instability and participate in oncogenesis and metastatic progression.
30278883,"In prostate cancer , DNA repair abnormalities mainly correspond to somatic or constitutional mutations of the BRCA2 and ATM genes."
30278883,"Therapeutic management of metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) is currently based on new hormonal therapies ( abiraterone , enzalutamide ) and taxane - type chemotherapy ( docetaxel or cabazitaxel )."
30278883,Preliminary data tend to indicate a specific activity of agents causing DNA breaks ( platinum salts ) and PARP inhibitors in patients with these DNA repair abnormalities.
30278883,The frequency of DNA repair gene mutations in patients with prostate cancer ( around 20 % ) and the antitumor response of PARP inhibitors make it a possible short - term therapeutic strategy with several registering clinical trials ongoing.
29549504,"Robot - assisted radical prostatectomy to treat localized prostate cancer has increased in popularity , although other options exist , including radiotherapy and active surveillance."
29549504,The decision about choosing the right treatment has become pertinent for many patients.
29549504,This literature review aimed to assess the current state - of - the - art regarding decisional aids and the associated decisional outcomes for the purpose of designing a method for both patients and doctors to use to make the best treatment decision for the patient.
29549504,"A literature search was conducted via MEDLINE , Embase , and Web of Science databases using the keywords "" prostate "" and "" cancer "" and "" impact "" and "" decisio * "" and "" treatment ."""
29549504,"Articles were included that focused on treatment outcomes , decision - making processes , and the use of decisional aids for localized prostate cancer."
29549504,"Articles that investigated prostate cancer in general or prostate cancer screening were excluded , as were articles that were not written in English."
29549504,"Altogether , 13 articles were finally critically reviewed for this study."
29549504,"Results were conflicting regarding the relations between patient factors , use of decisional aids , and decisional outcomes."
29549504,There was a large gap in the literature regarding the optimal decision - making process for men with localized prostate cancer.
29549504,The role of currently available decisional aids is limited to helping patients make the right decisions.
29549504,"There is a need to develop a novel decisional aid in which patient - physician discussion - involving evaluation of a spectrum of patient - , doctor - , and treatment - related factors - is included."
28635333,"Major advances through tumor profiling technologies , that include next - generation sequencing , epigenetic , proteomic and transcriptomic methods , have been made in primary prostate cancer , providing novel biomarkers that may guide precision medicine in the near future."
28635333,"Areas covered : The authors provided an overview of novel molecular biomarkers in tissue , blood and urine that may be used as clinical tools to assess prognosis , improve selection criteria for active surveillance programs , and detect disease relapse early in localized prostate cancer."
28635333,Expert commentary : Active surveillance ( AS ) in localized prostate cancer is an accepted strategy in patients with very low - risk prostate cancer.
28635333,"Many more patients may benefit from watchful waiting , and include patients of higher clinical stage and grade , however selection criteria have to be optimized and early recognition of transformation from localized to lethal disease has to be improved by addition of molecular biomarkers."
28635333,"The role of non-invasive biomarkers is challenging the need for repeat biopsies , commonly performed at 1 and 4 years in men under AS programs."
18568350,"This article reviews the definition , incidence , pathological characteristics and natural history of low risk localised prostate cancer."
18568350,"Low risk disease is typically defined as clinical stage T1 / T2a , biopsy Gleason score < / = 6 , PSA < 10."
18568350,This risk classification has provided a useful system for reporting of outcomes and for the production of clinical guidelines.
18568350,"However , the low - risk disease is a broad category with a range of pathological characteristics and clinical behaviour."
18568350,"Many , but not all , low - risk prostate cancers are clinically insignificant , destined never to cause any harm."
18568350,"The challenge of managing low risk localized prostate cancer is to distinguish patients with clinically relevant cancers , who may benefit from radical treatment , from the remainder who do not need any intervention."
18568350,"The natural history of untreated low - risk localised prostate cancer has not been well studied , partly because it is a relatively recent entity , and partly because it has been standard practice for men with low risk disease to receive treatment."
18568350,"Data from watchful waiting in the pre-PSA era , modelling studies to take account of the lead time and overdiagnosis associated with PSA testing , and the early results of active surveillance can all provide insights into the likely natural history of low risk disease."
18568350,There remains a major unmet need for markers of individual prostate cancer behaviour within the low - risk category.
18568350,"Such markers could be used to distinguish those men with truly indolent disease , suitable for observation , from those with significant prostate cancer that stand to benefit from treatment."
17432554,"Prostate cancer incurs a substantial incidence and mortality burden , similarly to breast cancer , and it ranks among the top ten specific causes of death in the United States."
17432554,It is inherent as we maximize the detection of early prostate cancer that we increase the detection of both nonaggressive ( slow growing ) and aggressive ( faster growing ) prostate cancers.
17432554,The evidence clearly supports the use of PSA screening in conjunction with DRE as a means of early detection of prostate cancer.
17432554,Widespread implementation of prostate cancer screening in the United States has led to the phenomenon of stage migration with more cancers being detected at a lower stage.
17432554,Such a trend has decreased the incidence of metastatic disease at diagnosis and paralleled the decrease of the mortality rate from prostate cancer.
17432554,"Our understanding of the natural history of prostate cancer is progressing over time , but the question of its length is unanswerable."
17432554,"The relatively long doubling time ( on average ) of early prostate cancer of 3 to 4 years or more indicates a relatively good prognosis for many men with this disease , even without early detection and treatment."
17432554,"Unfortunately , the poor specificity of the PSA test in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) leads to high rates of prostate biopsy and attendant illnesses and costs."
17432554,Early detection is more apt to detect a slow - growing prostate cancer than a faster growing cancer that is associated with a more rapid course of progression to metastatic disease.
17432554,"Hence , the launching of mass screening programs for the early detection of prostate cancer is premature."
17432554,"However , in the absence of solid evidence of benefit , one reasonable approach to screening at the individual level is to involve the patient in decisions about whether or not to perform a PSA test."
17432554,"Thus , "" offering "" PSA testing must be accompanied by informed discussion within the context of an ongoing patient - physician relationship."
17432554,"This is to be distinguished from the use of PSA testing for the purpose of "" mass screening ."""
17432554,Concepts that must be explored with the patient include : 1.
17432554,The long - term ramifications of screening 2.
17432554,The relatively high probability of further evaluation and biopsy with positive results 3.
17432554,"Potentially difficult decisions that may arise about using treatments that are associated with considerable morbidity and uncertain benefits ( at the time ) if cancer is discovered We should identify a future path that is evidence - based , focused on the issues that make a difference to patients , and results in better and longer lives of those with the disease and those who are at risk of getting it."
17432554,"If that path leads to treating fewer patients in the future , even if sometimes more aggressively , we should pursue it definitely and consequently."
27879495,"Within the Danish ' Diet , Cancer and Health ' cohort , we aimed to investigate the association between prediagnostic fish intake ( total , lean , fatty ) and ( a ) incidence of total and high - grade prostate cancer and ( b ) the risk of all - cause and prostate cancer - specific mortality among men with prostate cancer."
27879495,"Among 27 178 men , 1690 prostate cancer cases were identified through 2012."
27879495,"Of these , 1042 had a Gleason score of 7 or above and 498 had a Gleason score of 8 or above at the time of diagnosis ; 364 died ( n = 228 from prostate cancer ) during follow - up through 2013."
27879495,Cox proportional hazard models were used for the statistical analyses.
27879495,No association between any type of fish intake and risk of total prostate cancer or high - grade prostate cancer ( Gleason score ≥ 7 or ≥ 8 ) was found.
27879495,"For all - cause mortality , we found no association for any type of fish intake."
27879495,"For prostate cancer - specific mortality , only a higher intake of fatty fish was associated with a higher mortality [ per daily 25 g increment in intake ( mortality rate ratio = 1.27 ; 95 % confidence interval : 1.04 - 1.55 ; P = 0.02 ) ]."
27879495,"In conclusion , no strong association was found between fish consumption and the risk of or mortality from prostate cancer."
27879495,Only a higher intake of fatty fish was associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer - specific mortality.
25708578,The combination of radiation treatment and long - term androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) has been shown in multiple clinical trials to prolong overall survival in men with high - risk prostate cancer compared with either treatment alone.
25708578,New radiation technologies enable the safe delivery of high radiation doses that improve cancer control compared with lower radiation doses.
25708578,"Based on the results of multiple randomized trials , clinical practice guidelines for high - risk prostate cancer recommend total radiation doses of at least 75.6 Gy , with long - term ( 2 - 3 years ) ADT."
25708578,"Ongoing research into hypofractionated radiation treatment , whole - pelvic radiation , and combinations of radiation with novel hormonal agents could further improve cancer control and survival outcomes for patients with high - risk prostate cancer."
27728977,Aim : To review the current landscape of outlier genes in the field of prostate cancer.
27728977,Methods : A comprehensive review was performed.
27728977,Results : Prostate cancer continues to be a significant worldwide health issue.
27728977,"In the era of personalized medicine , more emphasis is being placed on the ability to determine the timing , intensity and type of treatment , according to each patient 's unique disease."
27728977,Several commercial tests are available to determine the risk of aggressive prostate cancer based on genomic biomarkers and gene expression.
27728977,Outlier genes represent a form of cancer classification that focuses on bimodal expression of a gene in a specific subset of patients.
27728977,"Outlier genes identified in prostate cancer include TMPRSS2 - ERG , SPINK1 , ScHLAP1 , NVL , SMC4 and SQLE."
27728977,Conclusion : Classifying patient prostate cancers by outlier genes may allow for individualized cancer therapies and improved cancer therapy outcomes.
24625881,"Glucocorticoids have been used in the treatment of prostate cancer to slow disease progression , improve pain control and offset side effects of chemo - and hormonal therapy."
24625881,"However , they may also have the potential to drive prostate cancer growth via mutated androgen receptors or glucocorticoid receptors ( GRs )."
24625881,"In this review we examine historical and contemporary use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of prostate cancer , review potential mechanisms by which they may inhibit or drive prostate cancer growth , and describe potential means of defining their contribution to the biology of prostate cancer."
32147685,"From a clinical perspective , prostate - specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) is a valuable target for both diagnosis and radioligand therapy ( RLT ) of prostate cancer."
32147685,The term ' specific ' has been used to characterize a histologic hallmark of overexpression in the membrane of most prostate cancer.
32147685,Many PSMA ligands have been developed since the previous decade and have been used in several clinical trials and clinical studies.
32147685,"However , procedure , specification , protocol , interpretation criteria , radiation dose , and cost - effectiveness of PSMA ligands have not been fully explained."
32147685,"Regardless of worldwide use of promising PSMA - ligand PET and RLT , it has not been approved in Japan."
32147685,Expedited introduction of PSMA - ligand PET and RLT to Japan and implementation of clinical study are eager for many patients with prostate cancer.
28980045,Prostate - specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) positron emission tomography - computed tomography ( PET - CT ) imaging for the localization of prostate cancer is increasingly available in Germany.
28980045,The advances and limitations in different disease stages are reviewed.
28980045,"As the clinical relevance of oligometastatic disease in primary cancer detected by PSMA PET - CT imaging is not yet completely understood , it should only be used in clinical trials."
28980045,"In recurrent prostate cancer after therapy with curative intent , PSMA PET - CT shows encouraging potential for the planning of salvage therapy."
28980045,In metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer evidence for its use is not available.
20414018,"The first edition of Clinical Practice Guidelines for Prostate Cancer was created mainly by the Japanese Urological Association as a part of the 2003 - 2004 Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare ( MHLW ) Scientific Research Fund - supported Thorough Researches for the Evaluation of Medical Technologies."
20414018,The guidelines were aimed to be used by general urologists committed to the treatment of all stages of prostate cancer patients.
20414018,The guidelines supervised by the Japanese Urological Association were published in May 2006.
20414018,The present edition of the guidelines are accepted as a good summary of prostate cancer treatment.
20414018,"However , since the present edition is over 3 years old , a revision of the guidelines is planned to update the contents and findings."
20414018,"In this article , I will summarize the changes and updates in each field."
16334137,"With the significant increase of the average lifespan in the industrial world , the number of elderly people , as a proportion of the total population , has risen dramatically."
16334137,"It has been estimated that this trend will accelerate and that , by the year 2020 , the number of people aged > 80 years will soar by 135 %."
16334137,"With age being the greatest risk factor for prostate cancer , this disease has understandably become one of the greatest public health concerns."
16334137,"Recently , considerable attention has been focused on prostate cancer management in the elderly , with specific emphasis on the question of whether , or not , it should differ from that of younger patients."
16334137,"We thoroughly reviewed the existing evidence on screening , diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer in the elderly and concluded that age alone should not constitute an obstruction for optimal treatment administration."
16334137,"Physicians treating aged prostate cancer patients should be trained in an individualized approach , based on clinical performance status and comorbitities."
18786842,The canine prostate gland shares many morphological and functional similarities with the human prostate and dogs are the only other large mammals that commonly develop spontaneous prostate cancer.
18786842,"However , the incidence of prostate cancer is much lower in dogs and the precise cell of origin is not known."
18786842,Dogs with prostate cancer usually present with advanced disease that does not respond to androgen deprivation therapy.
18786842,"Similar to humans , affected dogs often develop osteoblastic bone metastases in the pelvis and / or lumbar spine with associated pain and neurological deficits."
18786842,"Other clinical signs include weight loss , lethargy , and abnormal urination and / or defecation."
18786842,"Surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation have been used to treat dogs with prostate cancer , but success has been limited by the location and aggressive nature of the disease."
18786842,It is evident that better methods of early detection and more effective therapies are needed for prostate cancer in dogs and advanced prostate carcinoma in men.
18786842,Dogs with naturally - occurring prostate cancer are relevant models for the disease in humans and pre-clinical studies of new diagnostics and therapies in dogs may benefit both humans and dogs with prostate cancer.
29553949,Purpose of review : Summarizes recent advances in the treatment of metastatic castration - sensitive and castration - resistant prostate cancer.
29553949,Recent findings : New randomized data suggest a survival advantage to early abiraterone in castration - sensitive metastatic prostate cancer.
29553949,Prospective and retrospective studies are examining sequencing of existing cytotoxic and androgen - receptor - targeted therapies in both castration - sensitive and castration - resistant disease.
29553949,Genomic analysis of both circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor nucleic acids is being examined as a potential method for selecting existing therapies and identifying novel therapeutic targets.
29553949,"Finally , immunotherapy combinations are being evaluated in the setting of advanced prostate cancer."
29553949,"Summary : In this review , we hope to summarize the recent data supporting the use of early abiraterone in castration - sensitive metastatic prostate cancer and discuss how this data might be incorporated with previous trials showing a survival advantage to early docetaxel."
29553949,We present recent series examining sequencing of approved therapies as well as trials evaluating novel biomarkers and genomic analyses designed to help choose from among approved therapies or evaluate drugs in development.
29553949,"Lastly , we review ongoing trials examining novel immunotherapy combinations in advanced prostate cancer."
21319990,Proteomics has offered the hope of biomarker discovery to improve the management of prostate cancer.
21319990,"Markers are needed for screening and diagnosis , distinguishing latent from aggressive disease , defining the men who will benefit from therapy , differentiating localized from metastatic disease , predicting outcome and identifying new targets for therapy."
21319990,"There are many potential sources of proteins derived from the prostate , including urine , prostatic fluid ( expressed or ejaculate ) , serum , and plasma or tissue , each with distinct advantages and limitations."
21319990,"Equally , there are many methodological platforms for proteomic studies of the prostate."
21319990,"Despite the promise , protoemics has yielded little of relevance to the management of prostate cancer , and most of the work that has been published is either irreproducible or of no clinical value."
31629425,Men with germline mutations in DNA repair genes are at an increased risk of prostate cancer.
31629425,These germline mutations are commonly seen in conjunction with somatic DNA repair gene mutations in prostate tumors.
31629425,This indicates that men with a personal or family history of prostate cancer - as well as other cancer syndromes arising from mutations in DNA repair genes - should be considered for genetic testing and counseling.
30381857,"Introduction : The 2018 Coffey - Holden Prostate Cancer Academy ( CHPCA ) Meeting , "" Tumor Cell Heterogeneity and Resistance , "" was held in Los Angeles , California from June 21 to 24 , 2018."
30381857,"Methods : The CHPCA Meeting is a unique , discussion - oriented scientific conference convened annually by the Prostate Cancer Foundation ( PCF ) , which focuses on the most critical topics in need of further study to advance the treatment of lethal prostate cancer."
30381857,The 6th Annual CHPCA Meeting was attended by 70 investigators and concentrated on prostate cancer heterogeneity and treatment resistance.
30381857,"Results : The meeting focused on topics including : recognition of tumor heterogeneity , molecular drivers of heterogeneity , the role of the tumor microenvironment , the role of heterogeneity in disease progression , metastasis and treatment resistance , clinical trials designed to target resistance and tumor heterogeneity , and immunotherapeutic approaches to target and overcome tumor heterogeneity."
30381857,Discussion : This review article summarizes the presentations and discussions from the 2018 CHPCA Meeting in order to share this knowledge with the scientific community and encourage new studies that will lead to improved treatments and outcomes for men with prostate cancer.
17939301,Prostate cancer is now a common disease in men over 50 years of age.
17939301,"Medical therapies for prostate cancer are based on discoveries from the mid-twentieth century , and in the long term are rarely curative."
17939301,"Most treatments are directed towards an androgen receptor - expressing , highly proliferative target cell , which does indeed form the vast majority of cells in a prostate tumour."
17939301,"However , by invoking the existence of a cancer stem cell which , like normal epithelial stem cells in the prostate , does not express androgen receptor and is relatively quiescent , the observed resistance to most medical therapies can be explained."
17939301,"The phenotype of the prostate cancer stem cells is that of a basal cell and cultures derived from cancers , but not benign tissues , express a range of prostate cancer - associated RNAs."
17939301,"Furthermore , stem cells purified on the basis of alpha2beta1 high integrin and CD133 cell surface antigen expression , from an established culture of Gleason 4 ( 2 +2 ) prostate cancer ( P4E6 ) , were able to form multiple intraprostatic tumours in nude mice when grafted orthotopically in a matrigel plug containing human prostatic stroma."
17939301,The final tumours reexpressed androgen receptor and displayed a histology similar to that of a Gleason 4 cancer.
22369972,Prostate cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm in men and the second most frequent cause of cancer death for males in the United States.
22369972,"Recently , emerging evidence suggests that prostate cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) may play a critical role in the development and progression of prostate cancer."
22369972,"Therefore , targeting prostate CSCs for the prevention of tumor progression and treatment of prostate cancer could become a novel strategy for better treatment of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer."
22369972,"In this review article , we will summarize the most recent advances in the prostate CSCs field , with particular emphasis on targeting prostate CSCs to treat prostate cancer."
20538204,The diagnosis of localized prostate cancer is in constant modification.
20538204,Recent studies on early diagnosis and prognosis analysis have demonstrated the limits of using PSA.
20538204,The challenge for the upcoming years will be to adapt therapeutic strategies for each patient according to more reliable tests.
20538204,These objectives apply for DNA methylation analysis.
20538204,Hypermethylation of the promoter of gene implicated in the carcinogenesis of prostate cancer has been shown as an interesting filed for new tests.
20538204,"So far , DNA methylation tests were assessed on small cohorts of localized prostate cancer patients with promising results when applied on primary tumours and in urine , particularly for patients at high risk of progression after radical prostatectomy."
20538204,"Since the last phase of development for DNA methylation tests will be the industrialization and evaluation on large scale , it is important to have a synthesis on current knowledge of DNA methylation tests in the diagnosis of prostate cancer."
17321194,"Prostate cancer is the most common , non-dermatologic cancer in men."
17321194,"Since prostate cancer is highly associated with increased age , the incidence of this disease is expected to increase as the population ages."
17321194,"In its initial stages prostate cancer depends upon the actions of androgen , and androgen deprivation therapy induces tumor regression."
17321194,"Currently , androgen deprivation is achieved by either surgical or chemical androgen blockade."
17321194,"Unfortunately , nearly all prostate cancer patients develop tumors that grow despite androgen blockade and ultimately relapse."
17321194,Many alterations in prostate cancer cells contribute to this state.
17321194,"Although chemotherapy induces short remissions in some patients , there are no curative therapies for metastatic disease."
17321194,This review summarizes our current understanding in androgen signaling and the mechanisms that allow tumor cells to bypass androgen manipulation therapy.
17321194,The identification of novel survival pathways and effector molecules that drive androgen independent growth is necessary to develop effective therapies for advanced prostate cancers.
23761200,"In many studies , it has been demonstrated that ( 1 ) H MRSI of the human prostate has great potential to aid prostate cancer management , e.g. in the detection and localisation of cancer foci in the prostate or in the assessment of its aggressiveness."
23761200,It is particularly powerful in combination with T2 - weighted MRI.
23761200,"Nevertheless , the technique is currently mainly used in a research setting."
23761200,"This review provides an overview of the state - of - the - art of three - dimensional MRSI , including the specific hardware required , dedicated data acquisition sequences and information on the spectral content with background on the MR - visible metabolites."
23761200,"In clinical practice , it is important that relevant MRSI results become available rapidly , reliably and in an easy digestible way."
23761200,"However , this functionality is currently not fully available for prostate MRSI , which is a major obstacle for routine use by inexperienced clinicians."
23761200,Routine use requires more automation in the processing of raw data than is currently available.
23761200,"Therefore , we pay specific attention in this review on the status and prospects of the automated handling of prostate MRSI data , including quality control."
23761200,"The clinical potential of three - dimensional MRSI of the prostate is illustrated with literature examples on prostate cancer detection , its localisation in the prostate , its role in the assessment of cancer aggressiveness and in the selection and monitoring of therapy."
22470904,"There have been many significant advances in the treatment of prostate cancer , yet it remains a growing problem for men 's health."
22470904,"Many men die from prostate cancer each year and many more live with non-cancerous , but debilitating , prostate disorders."
22470904,"This article discusses advanced ( metastatic ) prostate cancer , provides nurses with an overview of treatment options available to men with this condition , and offers a starting point from which to examine further evidence."
22470904,It aims to encourage nurses to ensure that the patient is involved in making any decisions that could potentially impact on his health and wellbeing.
22470904,"In line with current thinking , the patient must be at the heart of every decision and be provided with greater choice and control ( Department of Health , 2010 )."
31629419,Genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified more than 170 single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) associated with prostate cancer risk.
31629419,Each variant is associated with only small increases in risk and is not predictive of an individuals ' overall risk of developing prostate cancer.
31629419,Polygenic risk scores ( PRS ) combining these variants are now clinically available and may improve predictive value of other factors such as PSA.
31629419,This overview reviews the current state of PRS for prostate cancer including testing considerations.
9987501,"Although the incidence of latent or incidental cancer of the prostate is quite similar among Japanese and Americans , the incidence of clinically manifest prostate cancer and the mortality rates of prostate cancer are significantly higher in the latter."
9987501,"But , recently , the incidence of clinical cancer in Japan has been increasing exponentially , and the change in dietary habits is considered to be a major cause of this increase."
9987501,"Comparing the histological differences of prostate cancer between the Japanese and the Americans , the cribriform pattern is predominant in Japanese clinically significant cancer."
9987501,"On the other hand , a simple glandular pattern is predominant in American clinically significant cancer."
9987501,These differences between Japanese and American prostate cancer suggest that each prostate cancer arises from different sources.
9987501,For the organ - confined prostate cancer ( stage A2 and B ) ; radical prostatectomy has been considered the definitive treatment.
9987501,But radiotherapy is now considered another radical treatment for localized prostate cancer which results in reduced morbidity.
9987501,A heavy particle beam and brachytherapy are an even more radical modality that can deliver a greater dose of radiation to a localized lesion without affecting the surrounding normal tissue.
9987501,"For locally advanced prostate cancer ( stage C ) ; For the purpose of downstaging and radical treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer , combination of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and radical prostatectomy has been expected."
9987501,"This regimen resulted in a significant decrease of positive surgical margins , but did not result in decrease of PSA failure."
9987501,The impact on patient survival will be determined by the long - term follow - up.
9987501,"For advanced prostate cancer ( stage D ) ; In the study of the comparison of bilateral orchiectomy with or without flutamide in stage D2 prostate cancer , neither significant improvement of combination group on progression - free survival nor overall survival has been shown."
9987501,"From this result , the true efficacy of MAB is not certain."
26436556,"Despite radical treatment , many men with prostate cancer will develop recurrence of their disease."
26436556,"In an exciting era of new therapies for prostate cancer in general , we focus on how these will specifically benefit those men with recurrent disease."
26436556,"We consider salvage treatments aimed at those with local recurrence confined to the prostate gland , therapies for those presenting with metastatic recurrence and the approach to men presenting with a rising prostate - specific antigen but no demonstrable disease ( M0 )."
26436556,"In general , men with recurrent disease are often under - represented in randomized clinical trials."
26436556,"Consequently , evidence to guide treatment for these men is often lacking and this needs to be addressed in order to improve and better define our approach to this problem in the future."
21912423,"Cannabinoids , their receptors and their metabolizing enzymes are emerging as a new regulatory system , which is involved in multiple physiological functions."
21912423,"Normal prostate tissue expresses several constituents of the endocannabinoid system including the CB ( 1 ) receptor , receptors belonging to the transient receptor potential family and fatty acid amide hydrolase , a hydrolyzing enzyme , all of which have been localized in the glandular epithelia."
21912423,"Accumulating evidence indicate that the endocannabinoid system is dysregulated in prostate cancer , suggesting that it has a role in prostate homeostasis."
21912423,"Overexpression of several components of the endocannabinoid system correlate with prostate cancer grade and progression , potentially providing a new therapeutic target for prostate cancer."
21912423,"Moreover , several cannabinoids exert antitumoral properties against prostate cancer , reducing xenograft prostate tumor growth , prostate cancer cell proliferation and cell migration."
21912423,"Although the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids against prostate cancer is very promising , future research using animal models is needed to evaluate the influence of systemic networks in their antitumoral action."
6387660,Prostate cancer is common among men in the United States.
6387660,"Factors of possible importance in the etiology of prostate cancer include diet , primarily implicated by ecologic studies of national , regional , and ethnic variation in rates ; endocrine function , implicated by the importance of endocrine function in normal prostatic growth and in the treatment of prostate cancer ; genetic susceptibility , supported by familial aggregation ; some aspect of sexual behavior , suggested by case - control differences in sexual behavior ; and occupational exposure , particularly cadmium exposure."
6387660,"Despite the public health importance of prostate cancer , it has received only moderate epidemiologic study ; thus the etiologic importance of these and other possible determinants of prostate cancer risk is uncertain [ 55 ]."
19202959,Malignant prostate tumors rank with its incidence among the most frequent tumors in man in Czech Republic.
19202959,Adenocarcinoma of the prostate due to its unusual behavior occupy especial position among solid tumors.
19202959,Large group of these tumors are at least initially sensitive to hormonal therapy.
19202959,After the introduction of PSA in the diagnostic methods we can gradually see shift of the new cases of prostate cancer to the localised stage.
19202959,Those are relatively curable.
19202959,"Movement to less localized stage diminishes the chance of recovery , but even the metastatic adenocarcinoma can be stabilised at least for some time."
19202959,The aim of therapy of hormonal refractory cancer is to maintain good quality of life and in some prolongation of survival.
24452740,The lack of reliable imaging tools in detecting prostate cancer makes a random biopsy still the standard of care to detect prostate cancer.
24452740,"To reduce the number of cores during a biopsy and therefore the risk of biopsy - related complications , an imaging tool which provides reliable guided biopsies is required."
24452740,Transrectal real - time elastography has shown to have the ability to visualize prostate cancer foci to some extent.
24452740,"In addition to the conventional B - mode image of transrectal ultrasound , it adds information about the stiffness of the prostate tissue."
24452740,This review highlights the most important studies on elastography to follow the improvements in techniques and to outline the ability to detect prostate cancer and guide biopsies.
16885911,"Background : The worldwide incidence of prostate cancer has been rising rapidly , likely due to intensified effort in early detection and screening."
16885911,Intense effort is also directed at novel schemas of chemoprevention and therapy.
16885911,Incidence data are insufficient to identify the true magnitude of prostate cancer in a given population.
16885911,The true prevalence of prostate cancer must be identified.
16885911,Methods : We reviewed the latest worldwide epidemiologic data and clinical studies on prostate cancer studying the true prevalence of this disease.
16885911,"Results : The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing worldwide , with strong variation among regions."
16885911,Prevalence studies based on autopsy data have confirmed a high frequency of latent prostate cancer in men of all ages.
16885911,"More aggressive screening measures using a lower prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) threshold , together with an increasing number of biopsies , have escalated the detection of these latent cancers."
16885911,Conclusions : Recent improvements in prostate cancer detection narrow the gap between the incidence and true prevalence of prostate cancer.
16885911,"This , however , raises concerns about the risk of over detection of latent cancers and thus identifying a need for improvement in screening strategies to better identify clinically significant disease."
19863346,Anaemia is a frequent complication of prostate cancer and of its treatments.
19863346,In Europe prostate cancer accounts for the 10.8 % of all malignant neoplasms.
19863346,Iatrogenic hypogonadism and age - related physiologic changes along with nutritional deficits contribute to increase prevalence of prostate cancer related anaemia.
19863346,"The reason of the present review is to provide clinicians with all aspects of a frequent and multifactorial co-morbidity , whose effects are often underestimated."
19863346,Erythropoiesis pathology and causes of anaemia in prostate cancer are reviewed.
19863346,Critical issues of clinical management of anaemia in prostate cancer are discussed.
15714965,"Basic , epidemiological and clinical issues to be solved on prostate cancer were discussed as a preface."
15714965,"Sharp increase of prostate cancer incidence in Asian countries , almost constant level of latent cancer are intriguing epidemiological and pathological issues."
15714965,"Treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer , hormone - refractory prostate cancer has been a long - standing clinical challenge."
15714965,New radiotherapy is expected for further advancement.
15714965,"Heterogeneity , clonility , multiplicity of prostate cancer are interesting pathological challenges."
15017185,Purpose : Several studies have examined the association between polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostate cancer risk.
15017185,"We evaluated the evidence on the association between the essential polyunsaturated fatty acid , known as alpha - linolenic acid , and the risk of prostate cancer in humans."
15017185,Materials and methods : We comprehensively reviewed published studies on the association between alpha - linolenic acid and the risk of prostate cancer using MEDLINE.
15017185,"Results : A number of studies have shown a positive association between dietary , plasma or red blood cell levels of alpha - linolenic acid and prostate cancer."
15017185,Other studies have demonstrated either no association or a negative association.
15017185,"The limitations of these studies include the assumption that dietary or plasma alpha - linolenic acid levels are positively associated with prostate tissue alpha - linolenic acid levels , and measurement errors of dietary , plasma and red blood cell alpha - linolenic acid levels."
15017185,Conclusions : More research is needed in this area before it can be concluded that there is an association between alpha - linolenic acid and prostate cancer.
24188255,Surgery remains a mainstay in the management of localized prostate cancer.
24188255,"This article addresses surgical aspects germane to the management of men with prostate cancer , including patient selection for surgery , nerve - sparing approaches , minimization of positive surgical margins , and indications for pelvic lymph node dissection."
24188255,"Outcomes for men with high - risk prostate cancer following surgery are reviewed , and the present role of neoadjuvant therapy before radical prostatectomy is discussed."
24188255,"In addition , there is a review of the published literature on surgical ablative therapies for prostate cancer."
16520275,"Numerous , relatively well - characterized androgen - independent osteotropic prostate cancer cell lines are now available to interrogate clinically relevant fundamental questions of prostate cancer metastasis and lethal progression systematically."
16520275,"Mounting basic and translational science efforts reveal that , very likely , the currently incurable form of androgen independent osseous prostate cancer originates from a more undifferentiated or "" stem cell "" like component , coexisting within a heterogeneous tumor mass containing more differentiated epithelial cancer subtypes."
16520275,"Current therapeutic preclinical investigations point toward the use of epigenetic modifiers , such as histone deacetylase inhibitors , to abrogate the continued survival of prostate cancer cells and likely can be used relatively chronically , with little morbidity."
16520275,"Telomere maintenance is critical in the immortalization of prostate cancer cells , and all known androgen independent cell line variants invariably express telomerase , and , thus , an argument can be made that these aggressive cells are likened to immature , progenitor variants."
16520275,"The arena of telomere biology has evolved enough to provide precise , nontoxic small molecule inhibitors of telomerase that limit viability of androgen - independent cell lines , yielding apoptosis."
16520275,Both epigenetic modifiers and telomerase - directed small molecule inhibitors have enhanced efficacy when given in combination with conventional and novel cytotoxic drugs.
16520275,"Better knowledge of the "" stem cell "" nature of prostate cancer will help direct the molecularly targeted therapies of the near future."
19562492,"Although tobacco use has been recognized as one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality , a role of smoking in the occurrence of prostate cancer has not been established."
19562492,"However , evidence indicates that factors that influence the incidence of prostate cancer may differ from those that influence progression and fatality from the disease."
19562492,"Thus , we reviewed and summarized results from prospective cohort studies that assessed the relation between smoking and fatal prostate cancer risk , as well as epidemiological and clinical studies that focused on aggressive behavior in prostate cancer , such as poorer survival , advanced stage , or poorer differentiation at diagnosis."
19562492,The majority of the prospective cohort studies showed that current smoking is associated with a moderate increase of ~ 30 % in fatal prostate cancer risk compared to never / non-smokers.
19562492,"This association is likely to be an underestimate of the effect of smoking because most studies had a single assessment of smoking at baseline and long follow - up times , and the association was considerably stronger in some sub-groups of heaviest smokers , or when smoking was assessed in a relatively short period ( within 10 years ) prior to cancer mortality."
19562492,"Using aggressive behavior of prostate cancer as outcome , current smoking was associated with significantly elevated risk , ranging from around twofold to threefold or higher."
19562492,"Although alternative explanations , such as publication bias , residual confounding , screening bias , and the influence of smoking - related comorbidities can not be ruled out entirely , these findings suggest that smoking is associated with aggressive behavior of prostate cancers or with a sub-group of rapidly progressing prostate cancer."
19562492,"Based on evidence presented in this review , cigarette smoking is likely to be a risk factor for prostate cancer progression and should be considered as a relevant exposure in prostate cancer research and prevention of mortality from this cancer."
32500468,Background : To determine prognostic factors associated with progression to castration - resistant prostate cancer following biochemical recurrence which is lethal prostate cancer and establish a risk stratification model of progression to castration - resistant prostate cancer.
32500468,Methods : We retrospectively reviewed the data of 550 patients who experienced biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.
32500468,The endpoint of the present study was progression to castration - resistant prostate cancer.
32500468,The actuarial probabilities of progression to castration - resistant prostate cancer - free survival were determined using Kaplan - Meier analysis.
32500468,Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of biochemical recurrence.
32500468,Results : Fifty - two patients experienced progression to castration - resistant prostate cancer during the follow - up period.
32500468,The progression to castration - resistant prostate cancer - free survival rate after biochemical recurrence at 10 years was 76.8 %.
32500468,"In multivariate analysis , pathological Gleason score ≥ 9 , lymphovascular invasion , and prostate - specific antigen velocity ≥ 0.4 ng / mL / year were independent predictive factors for progression to castration - resistant prostate cancer."
32500468,The patients were stratified into three groups using a risk stratification model incorporating these variables.
32500468,"The 10 - year progression to castration - resistant prostate cancer - free survival rates were 96.7 % in the low - risk group , 84.7 % in the intermediate - risk group , and 24.5 % in the high - risk group."
32500468,"Conclusions : The present results suggest that the pathological Gleason score , lymphovascular invasion , and prostate - specific antigen velocity were independent predictive factors for progression to castration - resistant prostate cancer."
32500468,The risk stratification model established in the present study could be useful for patient counseling and in identifying patients with a poor prognosis.
23811619,"Recently , many therapeutic agents for prostate cancer have been approved that target the androgen receptor and / or the prostate tumor microenvironment."
23811619,Each of these therapies has modestly increased patient survival.
23811619,"A better understanding of when in the course of prostate cancer progression specific therapies should be applied , and of what biomarkers would indicate when resistance arises , would almost certainly improve survival due to these therapies."
23811619,"Thus , applying the armamentarium of therapeutic agents in the right sequences in the right combination at the right time is a major goal in prostate cancer treatment."
23811619,"For this to occur , an understanding of prostate cancer evolution during progression is required."
23811619,"In this review , we discuss the current understanding of prostate cancer progression , but challenge the prevailing view by proposing a new model of prostate cancer progression , with the goal of improving biologic classification and treatment strategies."
23811619,We use this model to discuss how integrating clinical and basic understanding of prostate cancer will lead to better implementation of molecularly targeted therapeutics and improve patient survival.
26560323,Prostate cancer is the fourth leading cause of mortality in Australian men.
26560323,"The prevalence and incidence is increasing in both developed and developing nations , thus there is a need for better screening and management of this disorder."
26560323,"While there is no direct known cause of prostate cancer , management is largely focused on early detection and treatment strategies."
26560323,Of particular concern is advanced prostate cancer which can manifest as castrate resistant prostate cancer characterized by therapy resistance.
26560323,"This short review outlines the global epidemiology of prostate cancer , clinical manifestations , risk factors , current screening strategies including first line clinical screening as well as the use of circulating biomarkers , and treatment of prostate cancer through mainstream therapeutics as well as the cutting edge peptide and nano - technology based therapeutics that are being implemented or in the process of development to overcome therapeutic obstacles in the treatment of prostate cancer."
11702151,Transrectal ultrasound now plays a central part in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
11702151,"The role of ultrasound in prostate cancer diagnosis is to guide accurate biopsy , and current practice favours a systematic biopsy approach rather than targeted biopsy of focal abnormalities."
11702151,"The role of colour and power Doppler and sonographic contrast agents in prostate cancer diagnosis is still under evaluation , but these techniques may have a role in the assessment of the prognosis of an individual cancer."
24274615,"Introduction : Androgen deprivation therapy is the mainstay treatment for patients with prostate cancer who are not candidates for definitive treatment , are diagnosed with advanced disease on initial presentation or progress after primary treatment."
24274615,Patients who stop responding to androgen deprivation therapy develop castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ).
24274615,Emerging drugs undergoing clinical evaluation and drugs that have recently received FDA approval for the treatment of CRPC are reviewed.
24274615,"Areas covered : As the natural history and signaling pathways of prostate cancer are better understood , new treatments and targeted therapies will be developed."
24274615,The FDA recently approved 5 medications that increase survival in patients with CRPC.
24274615,Additional medications and drug classes are being explored that may eventually lead to new treatment options.
24274615,Articles were identified using a PubMed database search.
24274615,Expert opinion : Recent FDA medication approvals and the development of emerging treatments are promising for the future of patients with prostate cancer.
24274615,The addition of new medications challenges physicians to identify the optimal sequence and / or combination in which newer and older medications should be administered.
24274615,Physicians treating patients with prostate cancer have a growing responsibility to keep pace with these new medications so that they may counsel and treat patients appropriately.
24754104,Nurses are often key workers for patients with prostate cancer and are responsible for ensuring men have the support they need throughout their cancer journey.
24754104,This article provides an overview of the patient pathway.
30646512,Colorectal Cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the US.
30646512,"While the incidence and the mortality rate of colorectal cancer has decreased due to effective cancer screening measures , there has been an increase in number of young patients diagnosed in colon cancer due to unclear reasons at this point of time."
30646512,"While environmental and genetic factors play a major role in the pathogenesis of colon cancer , extensive research has suggested that nutrition may play both a causal and protective role in the development of colon cancer."
30646512,"In this review article , we aim to provide a review of factors that play a major role in development of colorectal cancer."
15639298,"Every year , more than 945000 people develop colorectal cancer worldwide , and around 492000 patients die."
15639298,"This form of cancer develops sporadically , in the setting of hereditary cancer syndromes , or on the basis of inflammatory bowel diseases."
15639298,Screening and prevention programmes are available for all these causes and should be more widely publicised.
15639298,"The adenoma - carcinoma sequence is the basis for development of colorectal cancer , and the underlying molecular changes have largely been identified."
15639298,"Prognosis depends on factors related to the patient , treatment , and tumour , and the expertise of the treatment team is one of the major determinants of outcome."
15639298,"New information on the molecular basis of this cancer have led to the development of targeted therapeutic options , which are being tested in clinical trials."
15639298,Further clinical progress will largely depend on the broader implementation of multidisciplinary treatment strategies following the principles of evidence - based medicine.
24639430,Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the Western hemisphere and the incidence increases with increasing age.
24639430,Most colorectal cancers are localized with or without lymph node metastases.
24639430,"Up to 20 % of patients present with metastatic disease , most commonly to the liver."
24639430,Surgery is the only curative therapy for localized colorectal cancer and adjuvant chemotherapy is usually recommended for patients with lymph node metastases.
24639430,"Surgery , radiation therapy and chemotherapy are the key components of rectal cancer therapy."
24639430,Selected patients with recurrent and metastatic disease can be salvaged with surgery but chemotherapy remains the mainstay of therapy for advanced colorectal cancer.
24639430,Substantial progress has been observed in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in recent years.
31232663,"Hereditary Colorectal Cancer : Clinics , Diagnostics and Management Abstract."
31232663,"About five percent of all colorectal cancers are caused by highly penetrant , autosomal dominantly or recessively inherited tumour predispositions."
31232663,"Current molecular genetic diagnostics , making use of high - throughput sequencing technologies , allow a cost - efficient , prompt and comprehensive investigation."
31232663,"In contrast to sporadic colorectal cancer hereditary forms are often associated with an elevated lifetime risk for additional , extracolonic tumours which necessitate specific long - term interdisciplinary prevention measures and surveillance."
31232663,"Moreover , the genetic confirmation of an underlying cancer predisposition allows family members at risk , following genetic counselling , the possibility of predictive carrier testing."
31232663,"This article aims at providing a concise overview of clinics , diagnostics and management for some of the best researched colorectal cancer predispositions."
29616330,Purpose of review : Colorectal cancer incidence has been rapidly rising in those under the age of 50 over the last 20 years.
29616330,"This paper will review the epidemiology , clinicopathologic , molecular features , proposed risk factors , and prevention / treatment approach for early onset CRC ( EOCRC ) patients."
29616330,"Recent findings : EOCRC appears to have a different spectrum of clinical , pathologic , and molecular presentation compared to CRC diagnosed in older individuals."
29616330,"EOCRCs are disproportionately located in the distal colon ; these patients tend to present with symptoms , and there is a longer interval between symptoms and diagnosis."
29616330,"There may be a distinct molecular signature , including progression through the microsatellite and chromosomal stable ( MACS ) pathway and LINE - 1 hypomethylation for a subset of EOCRCs."
29616330,The majority of EOCRCs are sporadic without clear risk factors that would have made the patient eligible for earlier screening.
29616330,There is an acute need for educational efforts aimed at both providers and patients to raise awareness about CRC in the young.
29616330,Improving adherence to screening in young patients eligible for screening and emphasizing early evaluation of symptoms are important steps to decreasing the burden of CRC in younger patients.
29616330,Modeling and empiric data are needed to determine whether our current screening approach should be modified and whether causation and treatment options may be different in a molecular subset EOCRCs.
27888866,Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent neoplasms in western countries ; it is the third most common cancer in men after prostate and lung cancer and the second most common in women after breast cancer.
27888866,Colorectal cancer is usually sporadic but in a small proportion is hereditary.
27888866,"The genetic cause is well established , allowing pre-symptomatic diagnosis in at - risk relatives."
27888866,"The present article reviews the most novel findings presented at the latest meeting of the American Gastroenterological Association on hereditary forms of colorectal cancer , especially Lynch syndrome and MUTYH - associated polyposis , as well as diverse organisational aspects that can favour the correct management of these patients and their relatives."
28501243,"A comprehensive approach to colorectal cancer includes thorough radiologic imaging , which allows appropriate initial staging of the disease , as well as subsequent surveillance for disease recurrence."
28501243,"Several imaging modalities are used with different associated advantages and disadvantages , which are outlined in this article with specific attention paid to the local staging of rectal cancer."
30465238,Background : Immunotherapy focuses on selectively enhancing the host 's immune response against malignant disease.
30465238,"It has been investigated as an important treatment modality against malignant disease for many years , but until recently its use was mostly limited to a few cancers."
30465238,The advent of new immunemodulating agents in the recent past has changed the landscape for management of many solid tumors.
30465238,"Currently , immunotherapy offers a valuable , and in many cases , a more effective alternate to the conventional cytotoxic therapy."
30465238,Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer - related death.
30465238,"Despite progress in systemic therapy , most patients with metastatic colorectal cancer die of their disease."
30465238,There is an unmet need for more effective treatments for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
30465238,The current data support that colorectal tumors are immunoresponsive and a subset of patients with advanced disease achieve long term benefit with immunotherapy.
30465238,Objectives : This review aims to provide the current status of immunotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
30465238,Methods : We researched sources published in the English language between January 2000 and August 2018 and listed within the PubMed database using combinations of the key words and reviewed the proceedings of international cancer conferences and current guidelines made by major cancer societies.
30465238,"Results : In this review , we summarize the current status of research on immunotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer and discuss various treatment modalities including checkpoint inhibitors , cancer vaccines , adoptive cell transfer , oncolytic virus therapy , and various other agents that are under investigation with a special emphasis on immune checkpoint inhibitors."
30465238,"Since the toxicity profile of immunotherapy is very different from conventional cytotoxic agents and could involve any organ system , we briefly review common adverse effects and their management."
25493009,"Imaging studies are a major component in the evaluation of patients for the screening , staging and surveillance of colorectal cancer."
25493009,"This review presents commonly encountered findings in the diagnosis and staging of patients with colorectal cancer using computed tomography ( CT ) colonography , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , and positron emission tomography ( PET ) / CT colonography."
25493009,CT colonography provides important information for the preoperative assessment of T staging.
25493009,Wall deformities are associated with muscular or subserosal invasion.
25493009,Lymph node metastases from colorectal cancer often present with calcifications.
25493009,CT is superior to detect calcified metastases.
25493009,Three - dimensional CT to image the vascular anatomy facilitates laparoscopic surgery.
25493009,T staging of rectal cancer by MRI is an established modality because MRI can diagnose rectal wall laminar structure.
25493009,N staging in patients with colorectal cancer is still challenging using any imaging modality.
25493009,MRI is more accurate than CT for the evaluation of liver metastases.
25493009,PET / CT colonography is valuable in the evaluation of extra-colonic and hepatic disease.
25493009,PET / CT colonography is useful for obstructing colorectal cancers that can not be traversed colonoscopically.
25493009,PET / CT colonography is able to localize synchronous colon cancers proximal to the obstruction precisely.
25493009,"However , there is no definite evidence to support the routine clinical use of PET / CT colonography."
26499755,Prevention is the main strategy in order to reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality.
26499755,"It can be accomplished through primary prevention , using measures affecting factors known to confer higher risk of colorectal cancer , or through secondary prevention , aimed at early diagnosis of cancer or preneoplastic lesions in groups of subjects at increased risk of cancer."
26499755,"Although primary prevention should be the goal for future years , because it acts on the probable causes of colorectal cancer , at present it seems that secondary prevention is more effective on colorectal cancer survival , and the approaches which have yielded the most satisfying results , in terms of reduced mortality for cancer , are those aimed at detecting preneoplastic lesions , or cancer at an early stage in selected groups of subjects at average or increased risk of colorectal cancer."
26499755,"These groups are subjects aged 50 years or older , affected individuals ( gene carriers ) or family members of hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes ( i.e. , Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis ) , and patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."
26499755,"The most effective procedures used , though with some drawbacks , are fecal occult blood tests and colonoscopy."
26499755,"Future research should be addressed to find new approaches that will render preventive strategies more acceptable for the population , and more cost - effective."
25195694,"Women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation are at high risk of breast and ovarian cancer , and may be at moderately increased risk of other cancer types."
25195694,This review examines studies to date that have evaluated the risk of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations for colorectal cancer.
25195694,"Accurate knowledge of colorectal cancer risk in BRCA1 / 2 carriers is important , because colonoscopy screening can prevent colorectal cancer through the removal of adenomatous polyps."
25195694,"Most studies that have identified an increased risk for colorectal cancer in BRCA1 / 2 mutation carriers were in high - risk cancer families , while studies that found no association were conducted in specific populations and involved the analysis of founder mutations."
25195694,"A recent prospective study of 7015 women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation identified significant fivefold increased risk of colorectal cancer among BRCA1 mutation carriers younger than 50 years [ standardized incidence ratio ( SIR ) : 4.8 ; 95 % CI : 2.2 - 9 ] , but not in women with a BRCA2 mutation or in older women."
25195694,"Based on this evidence , women with BRCA1 mutations should be counseled about their increased risk for early - onset colorectal cancer , and offered colonoscopy at 3 - to 5 - year intervals between the ages of 40 and 50 years , and should follow population guidelines thereafter."
30173217,"People with intellectual disabilities ( PWIDs ) are now living longer ; thus , the incidence of cancer within this population is increasing."
30173217,"Available data indicate an excess of digestive tract cancers in PWIDs , but colorectal cancer has rarely been specifically studied and has not been extensively reviewed."
30173217,"This is despite risk factors such as being overweight , obesity , and lack of exercise being more frequent in PWIDs."
30173217,"In this article , we examine the literature on the frequency , screening , and treatment of colorectal cancer in PWIDs by as sessing 4 databases , Medline , EBSCO - CINHL , ASSIA , and PsychLIT , from 1970 to February 2017."
30173217,Findings indicate that the frequency trends slightly higher than that found in the general population.
30173217,"Screening presents a unique opportunity to discover early colorectal cancer , but is underused in PWIDs compared to the general population."
30173217,"Furthermore , the clinical presentation is frequently masked , particularly by challenging behaviours , and colorectal cancer is therefore often diagnosed late , making treatment difficult due to the advanced stage of these tumours."
30173217,"To improve the care of PWIDs , we need more resources to support them and their caregivers , and to increase awareness of the risk factors and signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer."
29414818,Colorectal cancer is not one disease but rather a collection of neoplastic diseases.
29414818,"Due to heterogeneity in the disease biology , therapy response , and prognosis , extensive disease stratification is required."
29414818,"Therefore , TNM stage , microsatellite status , tumor grade , lymphovascular invasion , and other parameters are assessed in the pathology report to indicate the extent and prognosis of the disease."
29414818,"The mutation status of KRAS , BRAF , and NRAS is also investigated in a metastatic context to predict the response to anti-EGFR therapy."
29414818,"Recently , 4 distinct molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer have been described that have both prognostic and therapeutic relevance."
29414818,"In addition , characterization of the inflammatory infiltrate revealed major differences in the amount and location of inflammatory cells in distinct colorectal tumor types."
29414818,"Together , all of these parameters help to stratify patients into different therapeutic and prognostic subgroups."
29414818,"However , this stratification is not unambiguous since tumors often display intratumoral heterogeneity , whereby several subpopulations within one tumor show differences in morphology , inflammatory infiltrate , mutational status , or gene expression profile."
29414818,This article gives an overview of all of the current known data with regard to tumor heterogeneity at both inter - and intratumoral levels.
28391421,Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is the third leading cancer diagnosed globally and an important cause of cancer - related mortality.
28391421,"Of interest , while we have witnessed a declining incidence trend over the past few decades in the older population , incidence rates for adolescents and young adults have been increasing steadily."
28391421,"Several factors may well explain this apparent epidemic in the young , namely a lack of routine screening and emerging lifestyle issues such as obesity , lack of exercise , and dietary factors."
28391421,It is known that both environmental and genetic factors can increase the likelihood of developing CRC.
28391421,"Although inherited susceptibility is associated with the most striking increases in risk , and must always be considered in a young patient with CRC , the majority of CRCs are in fact sporadic rather than familial."
28391421,"Early - onset CRC is a truly heterogeneous disease , with mounting evidence to suggest that this patient population has a distinctive molecular profile , very different to late - onset CRC cases."
28391421,"Currently , both younger and older patients with CRC are treated in essentially the same manner , but with a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC in the young , we will have the opportunity to specifically tailor screening and clinical management strategies in this unique patient population in an effort to improve outcomes."

19283877,Understanding of the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis has been gaining momentum for some years on account of its high incidence and impact on the lives of individuals affected.
19283877,Different genetic abnormalities have been found in colorectal cancers from different sites.
19283877,"For example , proximal colon cancer is usually related to the nucleotide instability pathway , as microsatellite instability ( MSI )."
19283877,"However , distal colon cancer is usually associated with specific chromosomal instability ( CIN )."
19283877,"The development of cancer at the rectum , though similar to that at the colon , displays its own unique features."
19283877,These differences might be partially attributed to different embryological development and physiological circumstances.
19283877,"Environmental factors such as diet and alcohol intake also differ in their role in the development of tumors in the three segments , proximal colon , distal colon , and rectum."
19283877,""" Proximal shift "" of colon cancer has been known for some time , and survival rates of colorectal cancer are higher when rectal cancers are excluded , both of which emphasize the three different segments of colorectal cancer and their different properties."
19283877,"Meanwhile , colonic and rectal cancers are distinctive therapeutic entities."
19283877,The concept of three entities of colorectal cancer may be important in designing clinical trails or therapeutic strategies.
19283877,"However , the dispute about the inconsistency of data concerning the site - specific mechanism of colorectal carcinoma does exist , and more evidence about molecular events of carcinogenesis and targeted therapy needs to be collected to definitely confirm the conception."
27341604,"Treatment options have improved for patients with colorectal cancer , but these improvements have invariably been more modest than had been anticipated or hoped for."

29562407,"The revised part of "" Chinese Protocol of Diagnosis and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer "" ( 2017 edition ) involves new progress in the field of imaging examination , pathological evaluation , surgery , chemotherpy and radiotherapy."
29562407,"The 2017 edition of the protocol not only referred to the contents of the international guidelines , but also combined with the specific national conditions and clinical practice in China , and also included many evidence - based clinical data in China recently."
29562407,"The 2017 edition of the protocol would further promote the standardization of diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer in China , improve the survival and prognosis of patients , and benefit millions of patients with colorectal cancer and their families."
29796712,Colorectal cancer does not represent a single anatomic entity and side of origin has a key impact on prognosis and response to different systemic therapies.
29796712,"Compared to tumours arising in left colon , right colorectal cancers rely on the activation of different molecular pathways ( e.g. BRAF mutation and MSI status )."
29796712,"From a clinical point of view , this results in a different response to anti-EGFR agents."
29796712,"Current guidelines suggest the use of cetuximab or panitumumab in RAS wild - type disease and left colon cancer especially for cytoreduction / conversion purposes , since the expected benefit in right colon cancer is absent or clinically modest."
29796712,The prognostic role of microbiota in colorectal cancer disease deserves more clarification before being considered in common clinical practice.
29796712,Screening policies could also be affected by these new acquisitions.
29796712,"At the moment , sidedness should be considered as a strong prognostic variable and a surrogate predictor of different activity of anti-EGFR agents in the metastatic setting."
29796712,Its role in early stages of resected disease is still uncertain.
30961780,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors , and the morbidity and mortality are increasing gradually over the last years in China."
30961780,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( nCRT ) is currently applied to the treatment of colorectal cancer patients , and it is helpful to improve the prognosis."
30961780,The sensitivity of patients to nCRT is different due to individual differences.
30961780,Predicting the therapeutic effect of nCRT is of great importance for the further treatment methods.
30961780,"Texture analysis , as an image post-processing technique , has been more and more utilized in the field of oncologic imaging."
30961780,This article reviews the application and progress of texture analysis in the therapeutic effect prediction and prognosis of nCRT for colorectal cancer.
27380134,"The gut microbiota has been hailed as an accessory organ , with functions critical to the host including dietary metabolic activities and assistance in the development of a proper functioning immune system."
27380134,"However , an aberrant microbiota ( dysbiosis ) may influence disease processes such as colorectal cancer."
27380134,"In this review , we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the contributions of the microbiota to prevention , initiation / progression , and treatment of colorectal cancer , with a major focus on biofilms and the antimicrobial and antitumoural immune response."
25192361,"Colorectal cancer , as all solid malignancies , is accompanied by changes in the haemostatic mechanism favoring the establishment of a thrombotic potential , with platelets playing a key - role in this framework ; they further link colorectal cancer progression and hypercoagulation with the immune - response against the neoplastic spread."
25192361,"Under this rationale , various studies have assessed the use of platelet indices as prognostic markers of the biological behavior of colorectal cancer , demonstrating significant results."
25192361,"We herein attempt to summarize in a narrative and critical approach the relevant available data and the underlying pathophysiology , stressing the necessity of a more thorough understanding and future implementation of platelet indices in all stages of care we deliver to colorectal cancer patients."
27004798,Background : The counting of poorly differentiated clusters of 5 or more cancer cells lacking a gland - like structure in a tumor mass has recently been identified among the histological features predictive of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.
27004798,Main body : Poorly differentiated clusters can easily be recognized in the histological sections of colorectal cancer routinely stained with haematoxylin and eosin.
27004798,"Despite some limitations related to specimen fragmentation , counting can also be assessed in endoscopic biopsies."
27004798,"Based on the number of poorly differentiated clusters that appear under a microscopic field of a × 20 objective lens ( i.e. , a microscopic field with a major axis of 1 mm ) , colorectal cancer can be graded into malignancies as follows : tumors with < 5 clusters as grade 1 , tumors with 5 to 9 clusters as grade 2 , and tumors with ≥ 10 clusters as grade 3."
27004798,"High poorly differentiated cluster counts are significantly associated with peri-neural and lympho - vascular invasion , the presence of nodal metastases or micrometastases , as well as shorter overall and progression free survival to colorectal cancer."
27004798,Conclusion : The morphological aspects and clinical relevance of poorly differentiated clusters counting in colorectal cancer are discussed in this review.
19673013,"There are differences between African - American and white patients with colorectal cancer , concerning their characteristics before and after diagnosis."
19673013,Whites are more likely to adhere to screening guidelines.
19673013,This is also the case among people with positive family history.
19673013,Colorectal cancer is more frequent in Blacks.
19673013,"Studies have shown that that since 1985 , colon cancer rates have dipped 20 % to 25 % for Whites , while rates have gone up for African - American men and stayed the same for African - American women."
19673013,"Overall , African - Americans are 38 % to 43 % more likely to die from colon cancer than are Whites."
19673013,"Furthermore , it seems that there is an African - American predominance in right - sited tumors."
19673013,"African Americans tend to be diagnosed at a later stage , to suffer from better differentiated tumors , and to have worse prognosis when compared with Whites."
19673013,"Moreover , less black patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable colorectal cancer or radiation therapy for rectal cancer."
19673013,Caucasians seem to respond better to standard chemotherapy regimens than African - Americans.
19673013,"Concerning toxicity , it appears that patients of African - American descent are more likely to develop 5 - FU toxicity than Whites , possibly because of their different dihydropyridine dehydrogenase status."
19673013,"Last but not least , screening surveillance seems to be higher among white than among black long - term colorectal cancer survivors."
19673013,Socioeconomic and educational status account for most of these differences whereas little evidence exists for a genetic contribution in racial disparity.
19673013,Understanding the nature of racial differences in colorectal cancer allows tailoring of screening and treatment interventions.
23674867,Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide.
23674867,A model of cancer development involving cancer stem cells has been put forward because it provides a possible explanation of tumor hierarchy.
23674867,"Cancer stem cells are characterized by their proliferation , tumorigenesis , differentiation , and self - renewal capacities , and chemoradiotherapy resistance."
23674867,"Due to the role of cancer stem cells in tumor initiation and treatment failure , studies of cancer stem cell markers , such as CD133 , have been of great interest."
23674867,"CD133 , a five - transmembrane glycoprotein , is widely used as a marker to identify and isolate colorectal cancer stem cells."
23674867,This marker has been investigated to better understand the characteristics and functions of cancer stem cells.
23674867,"Moreover , it can also be used to predict tumor progression , patient survival , chemoradiotherapy resistance and other clinical parameters."
23674867,"In this review , we discuss the use of CD133 in the identification of colorectal cancer stem cell , which is currently controversial."
23674867,"Although the function of CD133 is as yet unclear , we have discussed several possible functions and associated mechanisms that may partially explain the role of CD133 in colorectal cancers."
23674867,"In addition , we focus on the prognostic value of CD133 in colorectal cancers."
23674867,"Finally , we predict that CD133 may be used as a possible target for colorectal cancer treatment."
21718591,Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world.
21718591,Many mouse models have been developed to evaluate features of colorectal cancer in humans.
21718591,"These can be grouped into genetically - engineered , chemically - induced , and inoculated models."
21718591,"However , none recapitulates all of the characteristics of human colorectal cancer."
21718591,It is critical to use a specific mouse model to address a particular research question.
21718591,"Here , we review commonly used mouse models for human colorectal cancer."
22156874,Epigenetic silencing of genes is now recognized to be an important mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in carcinogenesis.
22156874,"Because the role of genetic alterations in colorectal carcinogenesis has been well studied , colorectal cancer also offers an excellent model for elucidation of epigenetic mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis."
22156874,DNA methylation and histone modification are involved in a complex network to maintain gene silencing and cause carcinogenesis.
22156874,"DNA methylation of cancer - related gene promoters generally begins early in the process of tumorigenesis , affecting various types of colorectal cancer to differing degrees."
22156874,"These advances in the understanding of the biology of tumorigenesis can be expected to provide distinct biomarkers that will aid future diagnosis , risk assessment , and treatment methods for patients with colorectal cancer."
26520200,Colorectal cancer is the most frequent malignancy in both sexes in Spain.
26520200,"Between 20 % and 25 % of affected individuals have a family history of the disease , and 5 % to 6 % have a germ mutation , i.e. the disease develops in the context of a hereditary syndrome."
26520200,"The importance of identifying patients with hereditary syndromes predisposing them to colorectal cancer lies in the possibility of applying preventive measures , screening , and more appropriate management of both patients and their families."
26520200,The present article outlines the most important studies presented at the congress of the American Gastroenterological Association.
19267725,"This paper is a review of work done on colorectal cancer in Nigeria over the last 40 years showing geographic spread , age and sex ratios , predominant histopathology and paucity of polyposis coli syndromes."
19267725,"The male / female ratio is averagely equal , the peak age remains around 44 years , there is a significant subgroup of the under - 30s and there are more rectal cancer cases than colon cancer cases."
19267725,"Of the colon cancer cases , the caecum seems to be the more favoured site."
19267725,There seems to be quite a significant incidence of mucin - secreting adenocarcinoma subgroups which are said to carry a worse prognosis.
19267725,Almost all the authors have stated the rarity of polyposis coli syndromes ; a few have looked into the possibility of mismatch repair mutations as an aetiological factor.
8426990,This article takes the reader from colorectal lumen to the intracellular environment in an effort to explain the processes of tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer.
8426990,"The molecular changes seen in colorectal cancer development also are discussed , along with the potential for genetic manipulation and diagnostic molecular techniques."
8426990,An era of major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer has begun.
29083907,Colorectal cancer is a global problem worldwide because of its very high prevalence and mortality.
29083907,"Therefore , prevention of colorectal cancer and its early diagnosis is of great importance."
29083907,"In Croatia , the National Program for Colorectal Cancer has been carried out since 2007 ; however , the rate of response was about 18 percent , depending on the region."
29083907,Such a great public health and social and economic problem requires multidisciplinary approach in which family physicians have an important role.
29083907,"The well spread and developed network of primary health care and the availability of family physicians to each inhabitant have not been sufficiently exploited , especially for such preventive activities where family physicians could supervise program implementation."
10750881,"An estimated 129,400 new cases of colorectal cancer occurred in the United States during 1999."
10750881,The lifetime risk of developing this cancer is 2.5 to 5 percent in the general population but two to three times higher in persons who have a first - degree relative with colon cancer or an adenomatous polyp.
10750881,"Between 70 and 90 percent of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps , whereas only 10 to 30 percent arise from sessile adenomas."
10750881,"Tumors or polyps that develop proximal to the splenic flexure carry a poorer prognosis than those that arise more distally , in part because of delayed diagnosis secondary to later development of symptoms."
10750881,The Dukes system is the classic staging method for colorectal cancer ; the TNM staging system is more detailed and therefore more useful for surgical purposes.
10750881,"Although screening guidelines vary , most agree that colorectal cancer screening should begin at 50 years of age in patients without a personal or family history of colorectal cancer."
19793566,"Cancer is a genetic disease in which the clonal accumulation of genetic alterations confers a cell with the malignant characteristics of uncontrolled growth , local invasiveness , and metastastic potential."
19793566,"Studies of colorectal cancer and its precursor lesion , the adenomatous polyp , have served as the cornerstone in advancing knowledge of cancer molecular genetics."
19793566,The past 30 years have ushered in an era of revolutionary increases in understanding colorectal cancer genetics.
19793566,"In the future , it is hoped that the tremendous recent gains made in understanding colorectal cancer genetics will allow for significant , tailored chemoprevention and treatment of this common malignancy."
15161437,Over the last few decades it has become clear that highly penetrant disease genes are responsible for a minor proportion of colorectal cancer cases.
15161437,Families with hereditary syndromes are today recognized and included in surveillance programs known to reduce morbidity and mortality in colorectal cancer.
15161437,Colorectal cancer is preventable and screening strategies in whole populations are currently under debate.
15161437,"Colorectal cancer can be considered a complex disease , with a combination of predisposing genetic variants and environmental factors that contribute to the illness as a whole."
15161437,The progress made in the genome project provides an opportunity to determine such genetic variants and environmental factors.
15161437,This knowledge can be used to define a subpopulation at increased risk for colorectal cancer.
15161437,It will be more feasible to design preventive strategies for this subgroup than for a whole population.
27165364,"Colorectal cancer , encompassing colon and rectal cancer , arises from the epithelial lining of the large bowel."
27165364,It is most prevalent in Westernised societies and is increasing in frequency as the world becomes more industrialised.
27165364,"Unfortunately , metastatic colorectal cancer is not cured by chemotherapy and the annual number of deaths caused by colorectal cancer , currently 700,000 , is expected to rise."
27165364,"Our understanding of the contribution that genetic mutations make to colorectal cancer , although incomplete , is reasonably well advanced."
27165364,"However , it has only recently become widely appreciated that in addition to the ongoing accumulation of genetic mutations , chronic inflammation also plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of this disease."
27165364,"While a robust and tractable genetic model of colorectal cancer in zebrafish , suitable for pre-clinical studies , is not yet available , the identification of genes required for the rapid proliferation of zebrafish intestinal epithelial cells during development has highlighted a number of essential genes that could be targeted to disable colorectal cancer cells."
27165364,"Moreover , appreciation of the utility of zebrafish to study intestinal inflammation is on the rise."
27165364,"In particular , zebrafish provide unique opportunities to investigate the impact of genetic and environmental factors on the integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier function."
27165364,"With currently available tools , the interplay between epigenetic regulators , intestinal injury , microbiota composition and innate immune cell mobilisation can be analysed in exquisite detail."
27165364,This provides excellent opportunities to define critical events that could potentially be targeted therapeutically.
27165364,"Further into the future , the use of zebrafish larvae as hosts for xenografts of human colorectal cancer tissue , while still in its infancy , holds great promise that zebrafish could one day provide a practical , preclinical personalized medicine platform for the rapid assessment of the metastatic potential and drug - sensitivity of patient - derived cancers."
16389149,Surgery is a primary modality for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer.
16389149,"Before any surgical therapy , patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer require an evaluation."
16389149,"This preoperative evaluation can be used to assess the patient 's risk associated with surgery , plan the surgical resection , and stage the patient 's cancer."
16389149,Staging of the cancer preoperatively is primarily of concern in rectal cancer patients.
16389149,This article focuses on the elective surgical setting and the recommended preoperative evaluation of patients who have been diagnosed with colorectal cancer.
8281470,"In the United States , colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer mortality after lung cancer."
8281470,"However , incidence and mortality rates have been falling , reflecting improvements in primary prevention , early detection , and treatment."
8281470,This article reviews the major advances in the understanding and management of colorectal cancer.
7870142,"In the past few years , knowledge of the clinical , biologic , and molecular genetic characteristics of colorectal cancer has greatly increased."
7870142,"Although the most cost - effective approach remains to be identified , screening for colorectal cancer can decrease mortality due to this disease by detecting cancers at earlier stages and allowing the removal of adenomas , thus preventing the subsequent development of cancer."
7870142,Molecular studies that have helped define the genetic basis for this disease hold great promise for the development of better and more powerful methods to identify populations at risk.
7870142,"Individually , these technological , clinical , and basic - science advances are exciting ; together , they promise to move us closer to the goal of substantially reducing mortality due to colorectal cancer."
21199515,In 1991 this journal published the report of an international working party to the World Congress of Gastroenterology regarding the clinicopathological staging of colorectal cancer.
21199515,Since that time staging has continued to evolve as further prognostic factors in colorectal cancer have been elucidated in studies of increasingly large databases in several countries.
21199515,This review summarizes several of the key issues that have arisen during this evolutionary process and raises matters which still remain controversial in staging at the present time.
14971997,Colorectal tumours constitute an excellent system to study carcinogenesis and the molecular events implicated in the development of cancer.
14971997,"Attending to the way it is transmitted , colorectal cancer may appear in one of three forms : sporadic , familial , and hereditary."
14971997,"The sporadic form is most common and has no familial or hereditary associated factor thus far , while familial and hereditary forms show the same inheritance pattern."
14971997,Hereditary colorectal cancers develop by means of defined stages that go from lesions in the crypt of the colon through adenomas to manifest cancer.
14971997,They are characterised by the accumulation of multiple mutations in tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes that affect the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis.
14971997,"The colorectal carcinogenesis pathway is not unique and there are probably several ways for the initiation , development and progression of colorectal tumours."
8965369,Early colorectal cancer is situated at the field with a rich stock of topics in Japan.
8965369,"For this reason , there are increasing number of patients with colorectal cancer , many reports of depressed early cancer and rapid advances of molecular biology about colorectal neoplasm."
8965369,Most of early colorectal cancers are discovered to be the protruded type by all accounts in spite that many cases of depressed type early cancer have been reported in many Japanese institutes.
8965369,"The final diagnosis of early colorectal cancer is usually made by histological examination after endoscopic resection , however invasive cancers with distinct endoscopic appearance of submucosal spread should be treated surgically from the beginning after diagnosis on biopsy specimens."

11486985,"In its earliest , most curable stages , colorectal cancer is often asymptomatic."
11486985,"However , patients who report signs and symptoms , such as blood in the stool , abdominal pain , changes in bowel habits , unexplained weight loss , or iron deficiency anemia , should be referred for medical evaluation."
11486985,"The use of chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer , such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , hormone replacement therapy , and dietary calcium , holds significant promise , but further studies are needed before these agents can be recommended for cancer prevention in the general population."
11486985,"Surgical resection is the primary treatment modality for colorectal cancer , and adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in patients with stage III disease and some high - risk patients with stage II disease."
11486985,"Pharmacists should be aware that women are more susceptible to dose - related toxicity effects of fluorouracil and leucovorin combination chemotherapy , the first - line regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy."
11486985,"Conclusion : Although often perceived as a disease that primarily affects men , colorectal cancer is an equally important health concern for women."
11486985,"By providing education and counseling , pharmacists can help raise women 's awareness of this disease and encourage them to take steps to significantly reduce their risk."

32727186,"According to the China cancer statistics report in 2018 , the incidence and mortality of CRC in China ranked the third and fifth among all malignant tumors , with 376,000 new cases and 191,000 deaths."
32727186,"China has become the country with the highest number of new cases and deaths of CRC every year in the world , which seriously threatens the health of Chinese residents."
32727186,"In 2010 , the National Ministry of Health organized colorectal cancer expertise of the Chinese Medical Association to write the Chinese Protocol of Diagnosis and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer ( 2010 edition ) and publish it publicly."
32727186,"Since 2010 , the National Health and Family Planning Commission has organized experts to revise the protocol in 2015 and 2017 , while the National Health Commission revised it in 2020."
32727186,"The revised part of Chinese Protocol of Diagnosis and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer ( 2020 edition ) involves new progress in the field of imaging examination , pathological evaluation , surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy."
32727186,"The 2020 edition of the protocol not only referred to the contents of the international guidelines , but also combined with the specific national conditions and clinical practice in China , and also included many evidence - based clinical data in China recently."
32727186,"The 2020 edition of the protocol would further promote the standardization of diagnosis and treatment of CRC in China , improve the survival and prognosis of patients , and benefit millions of CRC patients and their families."

11284773,"In response , the American Gastroenterological Association , the American College of Gastroenterology and the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research have published recommendations for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance in patients with sporadic as well as hereditary forms of colorectal cancer."
11284773,"This review will focus on the basic molecular differences underlying the formation of carcinoma in patients with sporadic colorectal cancer , and the heritable syndromes of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) , and juvenile polyposis ( JPS )."
11284773,"By appreciating the molecular mechanisms underlying these four types of polyp cancer syndromes , the differences in clinical time course for progression from polyp to carcinoma and in current screening recommendations for patients with sporadic adenomas , FAP , HNPCC and JPS can be better understood."
2007,Integrins have direct effects in stimulating proliferation and preventing apoptosis in cancer cells and mediating proangiogenic interactions between endothelial cells and extracellular matrix.
2007,"Alterations of expression of various integrins and their receptors have been observed in various cancers in which angiogenesis is known to play a role , including colorectal cancer."
2007,Inhibition of specific integrins might thus inhibit both direct effects of integrins on cancer cells and tumor angiogenesis.
2007,"Inhibitory peptides and anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies are currently being investigated in clinical trials in patients with solid tumors , with early evidence suggesting clinical benefit in disease stabilization with use of an anti-alphaVbeta3 antibody in the settings of colorectal cancer , renal cell carcinoma , and melanoma."
2007,Integrin inhibition alone and with other targeted therapeutic approaches should be further investigated in clinical trials in patients with colorectal cancer.
21601788,Studies have shown that colorectal cancer ( CRC ) incidence is equal between men and women.
21601788,"However , several studies have demonstrated lower adenoma detection rates in women than in men."
21601788,"Many questions arise about differences in adenomas , CRC , and screening practices between men and women : should screening be the same for both sexes , are there differences in risk factors in the formation of colon cancer , should special groups of women be screened differently from the general population , are colonoscopies tolerated differently in women and why , and what determines if a woman will undergo colonoscopy?"
21601788,This article reviews these issues.
17476735,About 6 % of colorectal cancers are caused by genetic mutations associated with hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes.
17476735,"The most common hereditary cancer syndromes nurses are likely to encounter include hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer or Lynch syndrome , familial adenomatous polyposis , attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis , and MYH polyposis."
17476735,"Current colorectal cancer recommendations for risk management , screening , and surveillance are complex and based on level of colorectal cancer risk and whether an individual carries a genetic mutation associated with a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome."

2240880,Purpose : To examine studies of normal colon and colorectal cancer for evidence that the location of the primary tumor proximal or distal to the splenic flexure of the colon may determine distinct genetic categories of this disease.
2240880,"Data identification : Studies were identified through a manual search of journals , through MEDLINE , and through review of bibliographies in identified articles."
2240880,Study selection : Approximately 300 articles were examined.
2240880,About 150 articles were excluded because tumor location was not reported or was reported in a way that did not permit correlation with results or conclusions.
2240880,Data extraction : Articles were selected either because the presentation of data permitted correlation of results with anatomic regions of the colon or because they were relevant to inherited colorectal cancer.
2240880,"RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS : Differences were noted in biologic properties of proximal and distal segments of normal fetal and adult colonic epithelium and in the epidemiologic , pathologic , cytogenetic , and molecular features of proximal and distal colorectal cancer."
2240880,"Some differences correlated with the features of inherited colorectal cancer ( proximal , nonpolyposis or distal , and polyposis forms )."
2240880,Conclusions : Developmental and biologic differences in proximal and distal colon may reflect differing susceptibilities to neoplastic transformation.
2240880,Differences in proximal and distal colorectal cancer suggest that each may arise through different pathogenetic mechanisms.
2240880,Proximal tumors appear to represent a genetically more stable form of the disease and may arise through the same mechanisms that underlie inherited nonpolyposis colon cancer.
2240880,Distal tumors show evidence of greater genetic instability and may develop through the same mechanisms that underlie polyposis - associated colorectal cancer syndromes.
16682737,African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with and die as a result of colorectal cancer than white patients.

16682737,"Attention is focused on what is known about the role of socioeconomic status , cancer screening , comorbidities and lifestyle factors , tumor biology and genetics , and the differences in the receipt of and benefit of appropriate therapy."
16682737,"Finally , areas of ongoing and future research and policy initiatives aimed at reducing disparities are discussed."
25280546,"The aim of this study was to describe the knowledge , attitudes , and practices toward colorectal cancer prevention and care in Jordan."
25280546,"A survey was designed to produce reliable estimates for the population 's knowledge , attitudes , and practices in all 12 governorates of Jordan by using stratified random sampling."
25280546,"A representative sample of the adult population in Jordan completed a comprehensive tool which explored participants ' knowledge about the risk factors associated with colorectal cancer , cancer prevention through lifestyle changes , and early cancer diagnosis and screening."
25280546,"According to the participants ( n = 3196 ) , colorectal cancer had the second highest percentage of screening recommendation ( 12.6 % ) after breast cancer ( 57.3 % )."
25280546,Only 340 individuals ( 11 % ) reported ever screening for cancer.
25280546,About 20 % of the participants had heard of one of the screening tests for colorectal cancer.
25280546,"In fact , only 290 ( 9.1 % ) participants had performed the colorectal cancer screening tests."
25280546,This study provides data that will help colorectal cancer prevention and treatment programs and may enhance the efficiency of colorectal cancer - controlling programs.
25280546,The findings confirm the necessity of starting colorectal screening intervention that targets the most vulnerable individuals.
11969233,Knowledge of the descriptive epidemiology of colorectal cancer is essential to a better understanding of the aetiology of the disease and the development of screening strategies.
11969233,Considerable research efforts have been launched over the last 15 years to evaluate the ability of screening tests to decrease the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer.
11969233,This chapter provides a worldwide update of the incidence of colorectal cancer and reviews the evidence for screening for colorectal cancer based on published studies.
25110415,The development of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) can be influenced by genetic factors in both familial cases and sporadic cases.
25110415,"Familial CRC has been associated with genetic changes in high - , moderate - and low - penetrance susceptibility genes."
25110415,"However , despite the availability of current gene - identification techniques , the genetic causes of a considerable proportion of hereditary cases remain unknown."
25110415,Genome - wide association studies of CRC have identified a number of common low - penetrance alleles associated with a slightly increased or decreased risk of CRC.
25110415,"The accumulation of low - risk variants may partly explain the familial risk of CRC , and some of these variants may modify the risk of cancer in patients with mutations in high - penetrance genes."
25110415,Understanding the predisposition to develop CRC will require investigators to address the following challenges : the identification of genes that cause uncharacterized hereditary cases of CRC such as familial CRC type X and serrated polyposis ; the classification of variants of unknown significance in known CRC - predisposing genes ; and the identification of additional cancer risk modifiers that can be used to perform risk assessments for individual mutation carriers.
25110415,We performed a comprehensive review of the genetically characterized and uncharacterized hereditary CRC syndromes and of low - and moderate - penetrance loci and variants identified through genome - wide association studies and candidate - gene approaches.
25110415,Current challenges and future perspectives in the field of CRC predisposition are also discussed.
10647626,"The continuing increase in knowledge about the genetic basis of carcinogenesis has led to diverse efforts to exploit this knowledge clinically , primarily in the form of predictive genetic testing."
10647626,"In conjunction with family history , gene tests are intended to improve individual cancer risk assessment."
10647626,The objectives of predictive molecular testing are to identify the disease - causing germline mutation in an index person who has already developed the disease and to distinguish asymptomatic mutation carriers from non-mutation carriers within a given cancer - prone family.
10647626,"At present , genetic testing for colorectal cancer risk , primarily in form of DNA sequencing , is applied in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC )."
10647626,In these inherited colorectal tumor syndromes determining the genetic status may result in an individually tailored surveillance program and prophylactic treatment.
10647626,"The implications of genetic testing for the clinical management of disease , both of mutation and non-mutation carriers , in familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer families are discussed."
19072647,"Despite therapeutic innovations and increasing education on lifestyle to prevent colorectal cancer , it is still one of the most common cancer types , and for men the second cause of cancer - related death."
19072647,"Lately , much attention has been given to identify molecular markers involved in colorectal cancer prognosis and treatment with the aim to develop a more accurate classification system based on ( epi ) genetic alterations and , in addition , find markers that could potentially enhance management of colorectal cancer by predicting treatment response in advance."
19072647,"Although many genetic markers have been claimed to have prognostic or predictive influence , results are often inconclusive and , with some exception , they are not used in standard practice."
19072647,Epigenetic alterations have received less attention although they are probably even more interesting as they can potentially be reversed through drug treatment.
19072647,This review describes the current knowledge on the prognostic and predictive value of epigenetic markers in colorectal cancer.
23375250,The availability of sensitive methods has allowed the detailed study of circulating tumor cells only recently.
23375250,"Evolving evidence support the prognostic and predictive role of these cells in patients affected by several solid tumors , including colorectal cancer."
23375250,"Ongoing studies are aimed at confirming that the molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood and in bone marrow of patients is a powerful tool to improve the patient risk - stratification , to monitor activity of the drugs , to develop more appropriate targeted therapies and tailored treatments."
23375250,"In parallel , results from these correlative studies promise to gain a better biological understanding of the metastatic process."
23375250,The clinical utility of the detection of circulating tumor cells in patients affected by colorectal cancer is still hampered by a number of specific hurdles.
23375250,"Improvement in sensitivity and specificity of the available methods of detection , standardization of these methods and functional characterization of circulating tumor cells in well designed and statistically well powered studies are the key steps to reach these ambitious objectives in colorectal cancer patients as well."
25253945,Detection of cancer cells using molecular targets is achieved by combining immunochemical reactions with gene amplification techniques.
25253945,This enables the detection of cancer cells in specimens that are traditionally determined to be cancer - free.
25253945,These improvements in detection can lead to prognoses that are different from those derived by conventional pathological staging.
25253945,Survival is worse when cancer cells are detected in regional lymph nodes compared to when the nodes are cancer - free.
25253945,"Furthermore , the circulating tumor cell ( CTC ) count increases as the cancer progresses."
25253945,"Consequently , there is a correlation between CTC count and prognosis."
25253945,"However , large - scale prospective studies are required to confirm this."
25253945,The development of more convenient and cost - effective analysis techniques will facilitate the practical application of these findings.
15750858,Objective : The purpose of this review is to evaluate the published literature to assess social inequalities in colorectal cancer using the ' cancer disparities grid .'
15750858,Methods : Three computerized databases were searched from January 1990 to January 2004 to identify published English language articles that collected data from study participants living in the United States.
15750858,Abstracts were reviewed and articles that dealt with social inequality and colorectal cancer were selected.
15750858,A total of 46 articles were identified and classified into the appropriate cell of the cancer disparities grid.
15750858,"Results : The majority of research identified for the grid has focused primarily in one domain of inequality , race / ethnicity and racism , and within one column of the cancer continuum , cancer screening."
15750858,About one - third of the articles focused on multiple aspects of social inequalities.
15750858,"There were few or no published research articles within many of the domains of social inequality along the continuum of colorectal cancer prevention , treatment , and outcomes."
15750858,Conclusions : This review found only a modest amount of research has been conducted that has examined the influence of social inequalities on colorectal cancer.
15750858,Findings suggest that a multidisciplinary approach is needed to measure and remedy these social inequalities.
24196629,The molecular pathogenesis of colorectal cancer is heterogeneous.
24196629,"Whereas the majority of colorectal cancers follow the classical adenoma - carcinoma sequence and display chromosomal instability , a subset of approximately 15 % of colorectal cancers show a deficiency of the DNA mismatch repair system."
24196629,"These carcinomas present with numerous mutations at repetitive DNA stretches , a phenotype termed high - level microsatellite instability ( MSI - H )."
24196629,"The pathogenesis of MSI - H cancers is driven by mismatch repair deficiency - induced insertion / deletion mutations affecting microsatellites located in the coding region of tumor suppressor genes , such as TGFBR2."
24196629,The MSI - induced mutations of tumor suppressor genes not only lead to functional inactivation but also to shifts of the translational reading frame and consequently to the generation of frameshift peptides ( FSPs ).
24196629,These FSPs can be recognized as foreign by the host immune system.
24196629,"It could be shown that in the majority of MSI - H colorectal cancer patients , FSP - specific T cell - mediated immune responses can be detected."
24196629,These tumor antigen - specific immune responses are regarded as a major reason for the dense local lymphocyte infiltration which is typical of MSI - H colorectal cancer.
24196629,A further characteristic feature of MSI - H cancers is the occurrence of alterations affecting the cellular antigen presentation mechanism where beta2 - microglobulin ( B2M ) mutations that directly result from DNA mismatch repair deficiency represent the most common mechanism.
24196629,It could be demonstrated that B2M mutations are associated with M0 stage and a very favorable prognosis.
24196629,The characterization of the particular immunological properties of MSI - H tumors have paved the way for the initiation of a clinical trial in which FSP vaccination is currently being clinically evaluated in patients with MSI - H colorectal cancer.
9106701,"Introduction : The epidemiology of colorectal cancer has generated more interest recently , because recent developments in genetics , molecular biology , and genetic epidemiology have increased our understanding of the role of genes in the etiology of colorectal cancer."
9106701,Interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors in the etiology of cancer may be easier to define.
9106701,Epidemiology : Colorectal cancer is common in the Western world and is rare in developing countries.
9106701,A sharp increase is seen in Eastern Europe and Japan.
9106701,Etiology : Molecular genetics has shown that accumulation of genetic changes is important in the development of colorectal cancer.
9106701,Mutations in at least four to five genes are required for the formation of a malignant tumor.
9106701,Environmental mutagenic factors may determine which susceptible individuals grow carcinomas.
9106701,"Environmental risk factors for colorectal cancer are found in a western diet , rich in fat , meat , and animal protein and low in fiber , fruit , and vegetables."
9106701,The complex interrelations between food components make it difficult to define the precise role of specific food factors.
9106701,Prevention : Conclusive evidence of the effectiveness of primary prevention of colorectal cancer via dietary measures or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is lacking.
9106701,"Secondary prevention by interrupting the adenoma carcinoma sequence is an actual possibility , its effectiveness , however , needs to be determined."
9106701,"Molecular genetics holds a promise for identifying populations at high risk for colorectal cancer , therefore , targeting the screening to make it more cost - effective."
21635968,"Cancer is a heterogeneous disease caused , in part , by genetic and epigenetic alterations."
21635968,These changes have been explored in studies of the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) and have led to the identification of many biomarkers of disease progression.
21635968,"However , the number of biomarkers that have been incorporated into clinical practice is surprisingly small."
21635968,"We review the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of colorectal cancer and discuss molecular markers recommended for use in early detection , screening , diagnosis , determination of prognosis , and prediction of treatment outcomes."
21635968,We also review important areas for future research.
27294749,"Background : In the USA , race and socioeconomic status are well - known factors associated with colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates."
27294749,These are higher among blacks than whites and other racial / ethnic groups.
27294749,"Methods : In this article , we review opportunities to address disparities in colorectal cancer incidence , mortality , and survivorship among African Americans."
27294749,"Results : First , we summarize the primary prevention of colorectal cancer and recent advances in the early detection of the disease and disparities in screening."
27294749,"Then , we consider black - white disparities in colorectal cancer treatment and survival including factors that may contribute to such disparities and the important roles played by cultural competency , patient trust in one 's physician , and health literacy in addressing colorectal cancer disparities , including the need for studies involving the use of colorectal cancer patient navigators who are culturally competent."
27294749,"Conclusion : To reduce these disparities , intervention efforts should focus on providing high - quality screening and treatment for colorectal cancer and on educating African Americans about the value of diet , weight control , screening , and treatment."
27294749,Organized approaches for delivering colorectal cancer screening should be accompanied by programs and policies that provide access to diagnostic follow - up and treatment for underserved populations.
17329195,"Angiogenesis is a key factor in the growth and dissemination of colorectal cancer , with significant implications for its clinical management."
17329195,Previous trials have provided proof - of - principle that inhibition of angiogenesis has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of treatment for this disease.
17329195,Characterisation of the angiogenic status of the tumour on an individual patient basis could allow for a more targeted approach to treatment.
17329195,In vivo imaging techniques that assess tumour microvessel function have the potential to improve the management of treatment for patients with colorectal cancer.
17329195,This review focuses on MRI and CT assessment of colorectal cancer angiogenesis.
17329195,"We discuss the effects that these two techniques have had in the assessment of this disease , including tumour staging and therapeutic assessment."
17329195,"Their comparability with other imaging techniques , in particular ultrasound , and their limitations are also addressed."
25808439,"The cancer stem cell hypothesis argues that cancers depend on a specific type of cells , representing usually a small percentage of the total cancer cell population , termed cancer stem cells ( or tumor - initiating cells ) for their development and propagation."
25808439,In colorectal cancer these cells express specific surface proteins such as CD133 and CD44 and can recapitulate the whole tumor.
25808439,"Besides expression of these surface markers , stem cells are associated with a network of pluripotency transcription factors , such as Oct4 and Sox2 , which is present in them."
25808439,"Pluripotency factors are normally active in early development and characterize primitive cells , able to give rise to all different cell and tissue types of the three embryonic layers."
25808439,In this review I will discuss the relationship of these factors with pathogenic lesions in colorectal cancer and their prognostic implications.
31266924,"Purpose : This study aimed to examine the effects of a mobile navigation program on uncertainty , resilience , and growth through uncertainty in colorectal cancer patients."
31266924,"Methods : To verify the effectiveness of the mobile navigation program , 61 participants diagnosed with colorectal cancer undergoing surgery were selected."
31266924,A nonequivalent control group nonsynchronized design was used to evaluate the program.
31266924,"Uncertainty was measured using the Korean version of the Uncertainty in Illness Scale , resilience was measured using the Korean version of the Connor - Davidson Resilience Scale , and growth through uncertainty was measured using the Growth through Uncertainty Scale."
31266924,"Results : Compared with the control group , patients in the mobile navigation program group showed significant differences in scores for uncertainty ( F = 7.22 , p = .009 ) and resilience ( F = 4.31 , p = .042 ) , but not for growth through uncertainty ( F = 2.76 , p = .102 )."
31266924,Conclusion : These results suggest that the mobile navigation program has positive effects on decreasing uncertainty and increasing resilience among colorectal cancer patients.
31266924,The mobile navigation program could play a significant role in assisting colorectal cancer patients in regard to the continuity and usability of the program.
11036284,There is now solid evidence from randomized trials suggesting that it is possible to reduce mortality from colorectal cancer by 15 % to 25 % by screening with fecal occult blood tests ( FOBTs ).
11036284,The major benefit results from detection of early cancer in average - risk persons above 50 years of age who have a positive test followed by colonoscopy.
11036284,"However , it has to be demonstrated that the same acceptability can be reached in the general population as that obtained in trials."
11036284,Many countries must establish a screening organization in a limited area to learn how satisfactory quality assurance can be obtained before a country - wide screening program is set up.
11036284,"So far , screening has not resulted in a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer in true population studies despite removal of two to three times as many possible precursors compared to controls."
11036284,Cost - effectiveness will probably be as good as that known from screening for breast cancer with mammography and better than that for cervical cancer.
11036284,"However , the calculations are based on the unhydrated Hemoccult - II test in randomized trials."
11036284,"More sensitive methods would be attractive , but none has yet been evaluated properly in average - risk persons."
11036284,"There is no general agreement how to screen high risk groups such as patients with previous colorectal adenomas and carcinomas , one or two first - degree relatives with colorectal neoplasia , or ulcerative colitis."
11036284,"Families with familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer , however , are presented with firm guidelines."
11036284,Genetic screening has been helpful in no more than these two small groups in the colorectal carcinoma universe.
10647627,The basic mechanisms driving genetic instability underlie a new molecular classification of colorectal cancer that is assuming diagnostic and prognostic importance.
10647627,"These mechanisms and the criteria for stratifying colorectal cancer as microsatellite stable ( MSS ) , microsatellite instability - low ( MSI - L ) and microsatellite instability - high ( MSI - H ) are presented."
10647627,"This molecular classification is discussed in relation to morphogenesis , histopathology , behaviour and investigation of prognostic biomarkers in colorectal cancer."
10647627,"Clinical applications are considered , emphasising the role of the pathologist in identifying and working up cases of suspected hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer."
10647627,The principal value of microsatellite instability testing is in relation to the diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer.
10647627,"Demonstration of loss of DNA mismatch repair genes , notably hMLH1 and hMSH2 , by immunohistochemistry provides additional diagnostic information and may reduce the requirement for microsatellite instability testing."
10647627,"It is likely that testing for DNA mismatch repair will be adopted as a routine for colorectal cancer as more is learned of the distinctive pathobiology and behaviour of MSS , MSI - L and MSI - H cancers."
30588187,Background and Objectives : Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and the leading cause of cancer - related death worldwide.
30588187,"The impact of the primary tumor location on the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer has long been a concern , but studies have led to conflicting conclusions."
30588187,"Methods : In total , 465 colorectal cancer patients who received radical surgery were reviewed in this study."
30588187,Enrolled patients were divided into two groups according to the tumor location.
30588187,Disease - free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) were analyzed via the Kaplan - Meier method.
30588187,A Cox regression model was employed to evaluate the independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS.
30588187,"Results : The right colorectal cancer ( RCC ) and left colorectal cancer ( LCC ) groups comprised 202 and 140 patients , respectively."
30588187,Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the tumor location and TNM stage were independent predictors of DFS and OS.
30588187,"Subgroup analyses by stage demonstrated that there were significant differences in DFS and OS between patients with stage II and III RCC and LCC , but not for those with stage I colorectal cancer."
30588187,Conclusions : Patients with stage II and III LCC had better survival than those with RCC.
30588187,"However , this improvement in DFS and OS was not observed in patients with stage I colorectal cancer."
25927672,Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is one of the three topmost common cancers in men and the second most common cancer in women worldwide.
25927672,"With current advances in the medical and surgical treatment of CRC , care has slowly transformed to curative treatment."
25927672,"With these advances , CRC survivors are increasing in numbers and these patients have a unique range of medical , physical and psychological needs that require regular follow - up."
25927672,"In 2006 , the Institute of Medicine recommended that cancer survivors who are completing primary treatment receive a survivorship care plan."
25927672,There are many different programs of different complexity that are implemented for CRC survivors.
25927672,"This review outlines the needs of CRC survivors , the current surveillance techniques used in the continuing care of patients with CRC after curative treatment and the evidence behind these strategies."
28671042,Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the digestive system.
28671042,Surgery is currently considered to be the only radical treatment.
28671042,"As surgical techniques improve and progress is made in traditional radiotherapy , chemotherapy , and the implementation of neoadjuvant therapy , the 5 - year survival rate of early gastric cancer can reach > 95 %."
28671042,"However , the low rate of early diagnosis means that most patients have advanced - stage disease at diagnosis and so the best surgical window is missed."
28671042,"Therefore , the main treatment for advanced gastric cancer is the combination of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy , molecular - targeted therapy , and immunotherapy."
28671042,"In this article , we summarize several common methods used to treat advanced gastric cancer and discuss the progress made in the treatment of gastric cancer in detail."
28671042,"Only clinical practice and clinical research will allow us to prolong the survival time of patients and allow the patients to truly benefit by paying attention to the individual patient characteristics , drug choice , and developing a reasonable and comprehensive treatment plan."
32861308,Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer death globally.
32861308,"Risk factors for the condition include Helicobacter pylori infection , age , high salt intake , and diets low in fruit and vegetables."
32861308,"Gastric cancer is diagnosed histologically after endoscopic biopsy and staged using CT , endoscopic ultrasound , PET , and laparoscopy."
32861308,It is a molecularly and phenotypically highly heterogeneous disease.
32861308,The main treatment for early gastric cancer is endoscopic resection.
32861308,"Non-early operable gastric cancer is treated with surgery , which should include D2 lymphadenectomy ( including lymph node stations in the perigastric mesentery and along the celiac arterial branches )."
32861308,Perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with stage 1B or higher cancers.
32861308,"Advanced gastric cancer is treated with sequential lines of chemotherapy , starting with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet in the first line ; median survival is less than 1 year."
32861308,"Targeted therapies licensed to treat gastric cancer include trastuzumab ( HER2 - positive patients first line ) , ramucirumab ( anti-angiogenic second line ) , and nivolumab or pembrolizumab ( anti-PD-1 third line )."
24618998,"Less than a century ago , gastric cancer was the most common cancer in the United States and perhaps throughout the world."
24618998,"Despite its worldwide decline in incidence over the past century , gastric cancer remains a major killer across the globe."
24618998,"This article reviews the epidemiology , screening , and prevention of gastric cancer."
24618998,"We first discuss the descriptive epidemiology of gastric cancer , including its incidence , survival , mortality , and trends over time."
24618998,"Next , we characterize the risk factors for gastric cancer , both environmental and genetic."
24618998,Serologic markers and histological precursor lesions of gastric cancer and early detection of gastric cancer using these markers are reviewed.
24618998,"Finally , we discuss prevention strategies and provide suggestions for further research."
23129495,Gastric cancer is a prevalent yet heterogeneous disease.
23129495,"From diet and lifestyle to genetics and ethnicity , our appreciation of the complexity of gastric cancer has evolved."
23129495,This review will discuss the epidemiology of gastric cancer focusing on trends across various risk categories.
23129495,"We realize that gastric cancer is not merely a single disease , but rather individual diseases within a single organ - a distinction that will aid our understanding of disease heterogeneity and its significance."
25630323,Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer - related mortality and the fourth most common cancer globally.
25630323,"There are , however , distinct differences in incidence rates in different geographic regions."
25630323,"While the incidence rate of gastric cancer has been falling , that of gastric cardia cancers is reportedly on the rise in some regions."
25630323,"Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infection is a major risk factor of non-cardia gastric cancer , and data has emerged concerning the role of H. pylori eradication for primary prevention of gastric cancer."
25630323,"Dietary , lifestyle and metabolic factors have also been implicated."
25630323,"Although addressing these other factors may contribute to health , the actual impact in terms of cancer prevention is unclear."
25630323,"Once irreversible histological changes have occurred , endoscopic surveillance would be necessary."
25630323,"A molecular classification system offers hope for molecularly tailored , personalised therapies for gastric cancer , which may improve the prognosis for patients."
31236716,Purpose of review : Gastric adenocarcinoma is the fifth most common and the third most lethal cancer worldwide.
31236716,"Surgery is the only chance of cure , but recurrence is common , even with complete resection."
31236716,"Recent findings : Advances in diagnosis and staging , genomic classification , surgical resection and treatment of peritoneal disease , systemic chemotherapy and chemoradiation , and targeted and immune therapies have led to the current multidisciplinary approach to gastric adenocarcinoma."
31236716,Treatment of gastric cancer is rapidly evolving in an effort to combat this challenging disease.
23639637,"This review provides a state of the art description of gastric cancer etiology , the infectious agent , host factors , the precancerous cascade , clinical aspects , and prevention strategies."
23639637,"The biology of Helicobacter pylori , the primary causative agent , is discussed as well as the environmental factors that may modulate its effects."
27184043,Gastric cancer remains a prevalent disease worldwide with a poor prognosis.
27184043,Helicobacter pylori plays a major role in gastric carcinogenesis.
27184043,"H. pylori colonization leads to chronic gastritis , which predisposes to atrophic gastritis , intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia , and eventually gastric cancer."
27184043,"Screening , treatment , and prevention of H. pylori colonization can reduce the incidence of gastric cancer."
27184043,"Other interventions that may yield a similar effect , although of smaller magnitude , include promotion of a healthy lifestyle including dietary measures , non-smoking , low alcohol intake , and sufficient physical activity."
27184043,This chapter reviews interventions that can lead to a decline in gastric cancer incidence in high and low incidence countries.
16489633,The incidence and mortality of gastric cancer have fallen dramatically in US and elsewhere over the past several decades.
16489633,"Nonetheless , gastric cancer remains a major public health issue as the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide."
16489633,Demographic trends differ by tumor location and histology.
16489633,"While there has been a marked decline in distal , intestinal type gastric cancers , the incidence of proximal , diffuse type adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia has been increasing , particularly in the Western countries."
16489633,"Incidence by tumor sub-site also varies widely based on geographic location , race , and socio - economic status."
16489633,"Distal gastric cancer predominates in developing countries , among blacks , and in lower socio - economic groups , whereas proximal tumors are more common in developed countries , among whites , and in higher socio - economic classes."
16489633,Diverging trends in the incidence of gastric cancer by tumor location suggest that they may represent two diseases with different etiologies.
16489633,"The main risk factors for distal gastric cancer include Helicobacter pylori ( H pylori ) infection and dietary factors , whereas gastroesophageal reflux disease and obesity play important roles in the development of proximal stomach cancer."
16489633,"The purpose of this review is to examine the epidemiology and risk factors of gastric cancer , and to discuss strategies for primary prevention."
27531538,Gastric cancer ( GC ) ranks fifth for cancer incidence and second for cancer deaths.
27531538,Epidemiological data showed that survivors of Hodgkin 's lymphoma and patients with pernicious anemia etiologically linked to autoimmune gastritis are at increased risk of GC.
27531538,Screening of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease by means of pepsinogen ( PG ) I and PG I / II detected autoimmune gastritis with oxyntic gastric atrophy in one of four patients and may be recommended for GC prevention purposes.
27531538,The International Agency for Research on Cancer reported a positive association between consumption of processed meet and increased GC risk.
27531538,"A new GC risk prediction model based on biological markers , age , gender , smoking status , family history of GC , and consumption of highly salted food showed good predictive performance , and might prompt individuals to modify their lifestyle habits , attend regular check - up visits or participate in screening programs."
27531538,A novel GC classification based on gene expression of primary resected cancers correlated with clinicopathological features.
27531538,Noncoding RNA for GC screening remains the focus of multiple studies.
27531538,Patients with early GC undergoing endoscopic resection are more likely to develop metachronous lesions than patients undergoing surgery and endoscopic surveillance is warranted in this special cohort.

30512250,"The Dutch D1D2 Trial revealed a noncompliance rate of 51 % in gastric cancer patients who should have undergone a D2 dissection , while it disclosed that the D2 lymph node dissection group of patients exhibited a higher 15 - year overall survival ( OS ) rate , lower rates of local and regional recurrence , lower rates of liver metastases and lower cancer - related death rates compared to the D1 group , implying that the surgical technique per se may inﬂuence outcomes."
30512250,"On the other hand , the predominant up - regulation of invasive and metastatic genes in the Western tumor libraries , the diﬀerences in the criteria used for gastric cancer diagnosis in the East and the steady fnding that the Asian ethnicity is a favorable prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer treated in the US , have been proposed as possible explanations for the diﬀerences observed in the gastric cancer outcome between the East and the West."
30512250,"Moreover , literature addresses that gastric cancers in the East are mainly diagnosed at younger ages , they are of intestinal type , located distally , diagnosed at an early stage of disease , while gastric cancers in the West are mainly affecting elderly patients with comorbidities , they are of diffuse type , located proximally , and diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease."
30512250,"Future discoveries in genetics and molecular biology may clarify the characteristics of each tumor , while future achievements in imaging modalities and biological or target therapies may establish "" personalized "" therapies."
30512250,"Until that time , all eﬀorts for improving our surgical techniques and optimizing the perioperative care are mandatory."
2658642,"The overall cure rate for gastric cancer has changed relatively little in the United States over the past 30 years , largely because patients continue to present for treatment in advanced stages."
2658642,"The paucity of symptoms in early gastric cancer , the low incidence in the general United States population , and the lack of cost - effective screening methods suggest that improvements in early detection are unlikely."
2658642,"Hope for improved survival in late stage cases lies mostly in a better understanding of the pathophysiology and patterns of spread , in evolving techniques for more accurate perioperative staging , and in the gradually improving results of multimodality therapy for local - regional and systemic disease."
2658642,A proposal is made for a new staging system integrating newer approaches to staging and for controlled trials of multimodality therapy in patients unlikely to be cured by surgery alone.
31455923,"Gastric cancer is endemic in China , Japan , Korea , Brazil and Former Soviet Union."
31455923,Patients are diagnosed usually in locally advanced stage.
31455923,"Endoscopy , Positron Emission Therapy - Computed Tomography , Endoscopic ultrasound and staging laparoscopy are the tools for proper evaluation of such patients."
31455923,Locally advanced gastric cancer ( T2 - 4N0 or TanyN + ) requires multimodality treatment including surgery.
31455923,"Resection is the cornerstone of cure for gastric adenocarcinoma ; however , several aspects of surgical intervention remain controversial or are suboptimally applied at a population level."
31455923,Current evidence shows a D2 gastrectomy has got the best survival results.
31455923,At least 15 lymph nodes should be assessed for adequate staging.
31455923,"Laparoscopic resections should be performed to the same standards as those for for open resections , by surgeons who are experienced in both advanced laparoscopic surgery and gastric cancer management."

1549800,Early gastric cancer is a unique form of gastric carcinoma with an excellent prognosis.
1549800,"Now recognized worldwide , this tumor is most commonly diagnosed in Japan secondary to aggressive screening practices."
1549800,"Early detection is dependent on a low threshold for esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies , because specific symptoms and physical findings or diagnostic laboratory tests are rarely present with early gastric cancer."
1549800,"Once the disease is diagnosed , subtotal gastrectomy achieves survival rates equivalent to those of age - matched controls."
1549800,Consideration of total gastrectomy is warranted with proximal tumor location or multicentric carcinoma.
1549800,Radical lymphadenectomy should be undertaken in patients with regional nodal metastasis.
1549800,"After operative resection , patient outcome is usually excellent."
1549800,Large submucosal tumors with an aneuploid DNA pattern and nodal involvement denote a more ominous outlook.
1549800,Close patient follow - up is necessary to detect both the uncommon recurrence and the more common nongastric malignancy.
33256300,"Gastric cancer is the second most common and the second leading cause of cancer related mortality in China , which seriously endanger the lives and health of Chinese people."
33256300,"Due to the lack of typical symptoms and screening system of early gastric cancer , about 70 % patients with gastric cancer are diagnosed as locally advanced disease in China."
33256300,"Radical resection is the main approach for locally advanced gastric cancer ( LAGC ) , however , the clinical effect of gastrectomy alone or gastrectomy plus adjuvant treatment is limited."
33256300,"As a result , there has been increasing interest in the neoadjuvant treatment , which could potentially downstage tumor , eliminate tumor micrometastasis , reduce intraoperative dissemination and postoperative recurrence , thus improve the prognosis of patients with LAGC."
33256300,"The exploration and application of chemotherapy , radiotherapy , targeted therapy and immunotherapy of neoadjuvant treatment in LAGC have made continuous progress in recent years."
33256300,"To date , neoadjuvant therapy has been developed as a part of multimodality treatment for patients with LAGC."

24782602,Mexico requires a program for the prevention and control of gastric cancer based on national health indicators.
24782602,This should be produced by a multidisciplinary committee of experts who can propose actions that are relevant in the current national context.
24782602,The few studies of gastric cancer conducted on the Mexican population in national institutes highlight the poor connection that currently exists between the scientific community and the health sector in terms of resolving this health issue.
24782602,Public policies for health research should support projects with findings that can be translated into benefits for the population.
24782602,This review serves to identify national research groups studying gastric cancer in the Mexican population.
23967682,Infection with Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) is considered a prerequisite for gastric carcinogenesis and gastric mucosal atrophy that develops in association with the infection is a risk factor for gastric cancer.
23967682,The gastric cancer risk can be diagnosed by the ABC classification consisted of a combination of serum Hp antibody and the pepsinogen ( PG ) method.
23967682,The ABC classification may contribute to gastric cancer screening as well as to primary care of digestive organ practice.
23967682,"However , we should remember that we can not diagnose the gastric cancer by only the ABC classification , and an imaging examination is required."

27092990,"Anti-HER2 treatment , which is an effective strategy in metastatic gastric cancer , is now also being studied in the perioperative setting."
27092990,"However , resistance mechanisms in advanced disease are poorly understood and optimal patient selection remains challenging."
27092990,"Targeting angiogenesis is an emerging concept in the management of advanced gastric cancer , and ramucirumab has prolonged survival in the second line either as a monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel."
27092990,Biomarkers for selecting patients who benefit from ramucirumab are still lacking.
27092990,Immune checkpoint blockade and inhibition of cancer stemness targets are other emerging directions for the medical treatment of gastric cancer.
27092990,Large - scale international studies are ongoing.
27092990,Summary : Promising biology - based treatment strategies are evolving.
27092990,But tumor heterogeneity which is an inherent feature of gastric cancer challenges the development of molecularly targeted and personalized treatment strategies.
20410336,Gastric cancer is a cause of significant morbidity and cancer - related mortality worldwide.
20410336,"Despite recent advances in targeted therapy and understanding of the biology and development of the malignancy , progress in the treatment of gastric cancer has been limited."
20410336,"Most newly diagnosed patients will present with incurable disease , and have a median survival of less than 1 year."
20410336,"Although the disease has widespread ethnic and epidemiologic differences , medical management of gastric cancer does not distinguish among the various disease subtypes."
20410336,"The recent report of the ToGA phase III study has validated Her2 as a molecular target in this disease , supporting the concept that a greater understanding of the biology of gastric cancer subsets may improve treatment selection and overall outcome of individual patients."
20410336,This article summarizes the epidemiology and ethnic variation of this disease to crystalize subtypes of gastric cancer in the context of current and future medical management of advanced disease.
26917602,Laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer has become extremely widespread in recent years especially in Asian countries due to its low invasiveness.
26917602,"As to evidence of indication for laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer , laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer often appears to be indicated for early gastric cancer at many institutions , while evidence was considered to be insufficient to recommend laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer at Stage II and above."
26917602,There are also problems with indications for cases other than tumour factors.
26917602,"No meta - analyses and prospective studies have been reported , but outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer in gastric cancer patients with co-morbid and / or existing diseases have been reported in retrospective studies."
26917602,Indications in the elderly appear to be favourable in terms of post-operative ambulation considering factors such as the degree of dissection in accordance with the status of the patient.
26917602,"Meta - analyses , randomized controlled trials and several retrospective studies have compared the short - term usefulness of laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer with that of conventional gastrectomy."
26917602,"The superiority of laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer has been reported in terms of the reduced amount of bleeding , a reduction in the administration frequency and period of analgesic doses , a reduction in the duration of fever , early recovery of intestinal movement and early return to oral intake."
26917602,"A small - scale randomized controlled trial and several retrospective studies have demonstrated no significant differences in survival rate , recurrence rate and type of recurrence between laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer and conventional gastrectomy."
26917602,The results of the aforementioned trials in early gastric cancer in Japan and Korea for which enrolment is complete remain to be published.
28176656,The incidence of gastric cancer has been declining globally in the last decades.
28176656,"Despite the improvements in the diagnostic procedures , most cases are still detected at advanced stages due to lack of specific symptoms associated with early phases of tumour development."
28176656,"Consequently , gastric cancer poses a major health burden worldwide due to high mortality rates."
28176656,Continuing advances in high - throughput technologies are revealing an intricate network of genetic and epigenetic changes associated with carcinogenesis.
28176656,"In addition , several risk factors , both environmental and genetic , have been recognized , which promote accumulation of diverse alterations affecting the expression of oncogenes , tumour suppressor genes , DNA repair genes , and other genes , implicated in normal gastric cell functions."
28176656,A plethora of aberrant molecular events found in patients with this disease and intragenic heterogeneity of tumours from individuals are delaying the development of targeted biological therapies.
28176656,"Frequent occurrence of characteristic CpG island methylator phenotypes ( CIMP phenotypes ) in gastric cancers , particularly in association with Helicobacter pylori or EBV infection , could lead to introduction of epigenetic modulators into standard treatment regimens used against early and advanced forms of adenocarcinomas."
28176656,This review highlights aberrant DNA methylation events in the development of gastric tumours and addresses the different aspects associated with the application of therapeutic epigenetic modulation in the management of the disease.

25997695,Gastric cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and the second most common cause of cancer - related mortality worldwide.
25997695,An increasing number of recent studies have confirmed that gastric cancer is a multistage pathological state that arises from environmental factors ; dietary factors in particulary are considered to play an important role in the etiology of gastric cancer.
25997695,Improper dietary habits are one of the primary concerns as they influence key molecular events associated with the onset of gastric carcinogenesis.
25997695,"In the field of genetics , anticancer research has mainly focused on the various genetic markers and genetic molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of this of this disease."
25997695,"Some of this research has proven to be very fruitful , providing insight into the possible mechamisms repsonsible for this disease and into possible treatment modalities."
25997695,"However , the mortality rate associated with gastric cancer remains relatively high."
25997695,"Thus , epigenetics has become a hot topic for research , whereby genetic markers are bypassed and this research is directed towards reversible epigenetic events , such as methylation and histone modifications that play a crucial role in carcinogenesis."
25997695,"The present review focuses on the epigenetic events which play an important role in the development and progression of this deadly disease , gastric cancer."
19696534,Gastric cancer is the most common cancer in Korea and has overall survival rate of around 50 %.
19696534,Gastric cancer detected in early stage can be cured by endoscopic resection or less invasive surgical treatment and the subsequent prognosis is excellent.
19696534,National cancer screening program for gastric cancer has been available for several years.
19696534,The evaluation for efficacy of our screening strategy is strongly needed in terms of mortality reduction and cost - effectiveness.
19696534,Accurate diagnosis and staging evaluation is important for proper management and prediction of a patients prognosis.
19696534,It is recommended to understand the advantages and limitations of currently available guidelines and diagnostic modalities.
19696534,The 7th edition of gastric cancer staging system from AJCC may have significant effect on our knowledge and patient management.
26289363,Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) recently have been recognized as having a critical role in cancer development and progression.
26289363,Gastric cancer remains a major clinical challenge worldwide owing to poor prognosis and limited treatment options.
26289363,"Accumulating studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs may play an active role in tumorigenesis , metastasis , prognosis and drug resistance of gastric cancer."
26289363,"Here , we collect recent knowledge to show differential expression of lncRNA in gastric cancer and their underlying mechanism of activities in gastric cancer involved in epigenetic , transcription and post-transcriptional processing."
26289363,This review focuses on the regulation and function of gastric cancer - related lncRNAs and provides an overview of current effects to exploit them to be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for gastric cancer.
21129674,Radiochemotherapy Gatrointestinal intergroup study have demonstrated a convincing local control and overall survival benefit.
21129674,Oncologists and GI workshops have in the present not had a major interest in the radiotherapy treatment of gastric cancer due to a number of factors.
21129674,"Primary because toxicities may be severe , second physicians may have low experience in definition of clinical target volume and in third perioperative chemotherapy is widely used in this indication."
21129674,In Summary this issue should be used as guides for defining appropriate radiation planning treatment for the adjuvant postoperative therapy of gastric cancer.
30370504,Gastric cancer is the second most common malignancy and the one of the leading causes of cancer - related death in China.
30370504,"In particular , the survival rate of patients with stage IV or unresectable gastric cancer is very poor."
30370504,Conversion therapy for stage IV gastric cancer has been the main subject with much attention recently.
30370504,It is defined to achieve an R0 surgical resection after chemotherapy for originally unresectable cancer due to technical and / or oncological reasons.
30370504,"However , the optimal indications for conversion surgery are still controversial , and how to select the most appropriate candidates for conversion therapy remains to be clarified."
30370504,"A new biological category for stage IV gastric cancer proposed by K Yoshida from Gifu University has been tested out in some trials , from which stage IV gastric cancer can be divided into two different classifications based on the absence ( category 1 : potentially resectable metastasis and category 2 : marginally resectable metastasis ) or presence ( category 3 : incurable and unresectable metastasis and category 4 : non-curable metastasis ) of macroscopic peritoneal dissemination."
30370504,"The optimal indications for conversion therapy mainly include the patients with category 2 , and partially for patients with categories 3 and 4."
30370504,A surgery - oriented classification proposed by Peking University Cancer Hospital tried to classify the stage IV gastric cancer for conversion therapy.
30370504,"It would be classified as resectable and unresectable categories , depending on uhether R0 resection is available by preoperative evaluation."
30370504,"In this classification , unresectable cancer can be further classified as conversed , partly conversed and non-conversed types based on extent of cancer metastasis."
30370504,The resection of primary and metastatic lesion in unscreened stage IV gastric cancer was not testified to improve survival.
30370504,REGATTA trial has identified no significant difference in survival rate between the chemotherapy only and palliative gastrectomy with postoperative chemotherapy for stage IV gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor.
30370504,"With development of conversion therapy , a consensus has been reached that the patients with unresectable gastric cancer initially exhibiting one non-curative factor , if having clinical response to chemotherapy , may obtain a survival benefit from subsequent R0 radical gastrectomy."
30370504,Several novel combined chemotherapy regimens occasionally allow for conversion of an initially unresectable gastric cancer to resectable cancer in clinical practice.
30370504,Conversion surgery may result in long - term survival in selected patients who respond to chemotherapy.
30370504,"Several previous studies have evaluated the positive prognostic role of surgery after chemotherapy in stage IV gastric cancer patients with one non-curative factor , such as peritoneal metastasis , para-aortic lymph node metastasis or liver metastasis."
30370504,"Gastric cancer is a highly heterogeneous tumor in nature , consisting of varying aggressive biological characteristics."
30370504,"Oncologically stage IV gastric cancer is a systemic disease , and the complete response to any therapy is really very rare , so that conversion therapy is a great clinical challenging problem for gastric cancer patients."
30370504,"Due to the multi-pathway metastasis , perioperative systemic chemotherapy is the most important in conversion therapy for stage IV gastric cancer , and a radical surgical resection is the key to improve prognosis."
30370504,"A good local control does not necessarily lead to prolonged survival in patients with stage IV gastric cancer , in which other sites metastases often emerge even after successful local - regional cancer - oriented treatment."
30370504,"To date , most reports of conversion therapy for gastric cancer were from single - center or retrospective study."
30370504,"If more reliable evidences are to be obtained , more multi-center and prospective RCT studies must be carried out."
31453724,RASSF2 is a tumor suppressor gene closely related to gastric cancer.
31453724,This meta - analysis was designed to assess the quality in the previous studies and establish the value of RASSF2 methylation in the prediction and prognosis of gastric cancer.
31453724,"The eligible literatures with publication deadline of May 3 , 2019 were collected from PubMed , EMBASE , CNKI , Wanfang , and CNVIP databases."
31453724,The correlation between RASSF2 methylation level and gastric cancer was estimated by odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval ( OR and 95 % CI ) values.
31453724,A total of eight articles were included in the study.
31453724,A total of 517 gastric cancer tissue samples and 517 adjacent nontumor tissue samples were included.
31453724,"The results of the analysis showed that RASSF2 had a significantly higher level of methylation in gastric cancer ( OR = 17.56 , 95 % CI = 7.11 - 43.35 , p - value = 0.009 )."
31453724,"Meanwhile , we tested whether there was association of RASSF2 methylation with tumor metastasis , and we also analyzed whether there was a gender difference in RASSF2 methylation."
31453724,"However , our results showed no statistical significance of the two aforementioned tests ( p > 0.1 )."
31453724,Our study suggested that RASSF2 methylation could predict the risk of gastric cancer.
31453724,"However , it might not be feasible for the prediction of tumor metastasis."
28181265,There has been a great deal of interest about varying treatment paradigms of gastric cancer in Eastern and Western countries.
28181265,"Differences in tumor biology , screening initiatives , surgical approach , extent of lymphadenectomy , and neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy regimens have been studied and documented in the literature."
28181265,The purpose of this review is to give an updated report on the current status and management differences in the treatment of gastric cancer between Eastern and Western countries.
24914327,The incidence rate of gastric cancer is much higher in Asia than in the Western industrial nations.
24914327,According to the different screening programs in Japan and Korea about fifty percent of treated patients had an early tumor stage.
24914327,"In contrast , European and American patients with gastric cancer had an advanced tumor stage."
24914327,"Therefore , the experience for the various therapeutic options for gastric cancer may be different between these regions."
24914327,In this review we tried to point out the treatment modalities in Western industrial countries for early gastric cancer.
16836062,Das Magenkarzinom ist nach wie vor die vierthäufigste Tumorentität und die zweithäufigste tumorassoziierte Todesursache weltweit.
16836062,"Die distalen Magenkarzinome sind zwar in ihrer Inzidenz abnehmend , aber durch ihre hohen Mortalitätsraten weiter ein bedeutendes klinisches Problem."
16836062,Im Gegensatz hierzu sind die Tumoren des gastro - ösophagealen Übergangs die am stärksten zunehmenden Neoplasien der westlichen Welt.
16836062,"Das Magenkarzinom wird meistens erst in fortgeschrittenen Stadien diagnostiziert , zu einem Zeitpunkt bei dem die Behandlungsmöglichkeiten schon sehr eingeschränkt sind."
16836062,Dies führt insgesamt zu einer nach wie vor sehr schlechten Prognose dieser Tumorerkrankung.
16836062,Über die letzten 15 Jahre wurden einige Fortschritte im Verständnis der Risikofaktoren und Pathogenese des Magenkarzinoms gemacht.
16836062,"Als wichtigster , exogener Risikofaktor wurde Helicobacter pylori von der WHO als ein Klasse - I - Karzinogen eingestuft."
16836062,"Ebenso konnten in den letzten Jahren verschiedene genetische Veränderungen , die mit einem erhöhten Risiko eines Magenkarzinoms assoziiert sind , definiert werden."
16836062,"Auch im Bereich der Therapie des Magenkarzinoms sind durch neue multimodale Strategien , wenn auch erst langsam , Fortschritte erzielt worden."
16836062,"In Zukunft könnten diese Errungenschaften zum einen zu einer besseren Früherkennung von Risikopatienten , zum anderen , durch den gezielten Einsatz von derzeit multimodalen und in Zukunft vielleicht gezielten Therapieansätzen , zur Verbesserung der Prognose dieser Tumorentität führen."
16836062,Gastric cancer is the fourth common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths.
16836062,"Although the incidence of gastric cancer is declining , gastric cancer will remain a serious medical problem due to its high mortality rates."
16836062,"In contrast , cancer of the gastro - esophageal junction is the most increasing neoplasm in the western world."
16836062,"Unfortunately , the vast majority of gastric cancer is diagnosed at an advanced stage , associated with a poor prognosis where the therapeutic options are limited."
16836062,Over the past 15 years advances have been made in the knowledge of risk factors as well as the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.
16836062,As the most important exogenous risk factor Helicobacter pylori was categorized as a class I carcinogen by the WHO.
16836062,"Additionally , genetic changes associated with the risk of gastric cancer have been defined."
16836062,"Progress , although slow , has also been made in the non-surgical therapy of gastric cancer due to multimodal therapeutic strategies."
16836062,All these advances could lead to a better identification of patients being at risk of developing gastric cancer.
16836062,"Furthermore , new neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy regimes as well as targeted therapeutic approaches in the future could lead to a better prognosis of gastric cancer."
18674700,"Early gastric cancer is a curable disease regardless of its location , histologic type , genetic changes , or the ethnicity of the patient."
18674700,"To improve the detection rate of early gastric cancer , intensive training of endoscopists and the use of novel endoscopic techniques have been introduced into routine examinations in Japan."
18674700,"In the United States , where most gastric cancer is found in advanced stages , a similar approach should be advocated."
18674700,Endoscopic resection of high - grade dysplasia is also encouraged in the United States not only for proper diagnosis but also for achieving cure without surgical intervention.
25439075,"Gastric cancer is the third cause of cancer death worldwide , and Helicobacter pylori infection causes almost 90 % of non-cardia cancers , the predominant type."
25439075,"H. pylori infection is treatable , and in clinical trials there is evidence of a 30 - 40 % reduction in incidence of gastric cancer among treated subjects."
25439075,"However , with a few exceptions , there are no public health programmes for gastric cancer prevention."
25439075,"In December 2013 , the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) , organized a Working Group of international experts to discuss and make recommendations for gastric cancer control."
25439075,"The Working Group considered that the enormous burden of disease , which is not expected to decline in the coming decades , requires decisive public health action to include gastric cancer in cancer control programmes."
25439075,"Interventions should be tailored to the local conditions and consider population - based screening and eradication of H. pylori , in the context of evaluation of feasibility , efficacy and adverse consequences."
26494953,Gastric cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer and represents a major cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide.
26494953,"With recent biomedical advances in our understanding of the molecular characteristics of gastric cancer , many genetic alterations have been identified as potential targets for its treatment."
26494953,Multiple novel agents are currently under development as the demand for active agents that improve the survival of gastric cancer patients constantly increases.
26494953,"Based on lessons from previous trials of targeted agents , it is now widely accepted that the establishment of an optimal diagnostic test to select molecularly defined patients is of equal importance to the development of active agents against targetable genetic alterations."
26494953,"Herein , we highlight the current status and future perspectives of companion diagnostics in the treatment of gastric cancer."
26314673,"Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy for chronic gastritis achieved world - first coverage by the Japanese national health insurance scheme in 2013 , making a dramatic decrease of gastric cancer - related deaths more realistic."
26314673,Combining H pylori eradication therapy with endoscopic surveillance can prevent the development of gastric cancer.
26314673,"Even if it develops , most patients are likely to be diagnosed at an early stage , possibly resulting in fewer gastric cancer deaths."
26314673,"Success with the elimination of gastric cancer in Japan could lead other countries with a high incidence to consider a similar strategy , suggesting the potential for elimination of gastric cancer around the world."
25060632,"MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors by inhibiting the expression of target genes , some of which are either directly or indirectly involved with canonical signaling pathways."
25060632,The relationship between miRNAs and signaling pathways in gastric cancer is extremely complicated.
25060632,"In this paper , we determined the pathogenic mechanism of gastric cancer related to miRNA expression based on recent high - quality studies and then clarified the regulation network of miRNA expression and the correlated functions of these miRNAs during the progression of gastric cancer."
25060632,We try to illustrate the correlation between the expression of miRNAs and outcomes of patients with gastric cancer.
25060632,Understanding this will allow us to take a big step forward in the treatment of gastric cancer.
24259966,"Although the incidence of gastric cancer has been declining in recent decades , it remains a major public health issue as the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide."
24259966,"In China , gastric cancer is still the main cause of death in patients with malignant tumors."
24259966,Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage and mortality is high.
24259966,Cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) is a rate - limiting enzyme in prostanoid synthesis and plays an important role in the development and progression of gastric cancer.
24259966,The expression of COX - 2 in gastric cancer is upregulated and its molecular mechanisms have been investigated.
24259966,"Helicobacter pylori infection , tumor suppressor gene mutation and the activation of nuclear factor - kappa B may be responsible for the elevated expression of COX - 2 in gastric cancer."
24259966,"The mechanisms of COX - 2 in the development and progression of gastric cancer are probably through promoting the proliferation of gastric cancer cells , while inhibiting apoptosis , assisting angiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis , and participating in cancer invasion and immunosuppression."
24259966,"This review is intended to discuss , comment and summarize recent research progress on the role of COX - 2 in gastric cancer development and progression , and elucidate the molecular mechanisms which might be involved in the carcinogenesis."
10593993,Families with autosomal dominant inherited predisposition to gastric cancer have been described.
10593993,"More recently , germline E - cadherin / CDH1 mutations have been identified in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer kindred."
10593993,"The need to have protocols to manage and counsel these families in the clinic led a group of geneticists , gastroenterologists , surgeons , oncologists , pathologists , and molecular biologists to convene a workshop to produce consensus statements and guidelines for familial gastric cancer."
10593993,Review of the available cancer pathology from people belonging to families with documented germline E - cadherin / CDH1 mutations confirmed that the gastric cancers were all of the diffuse type.
10593993,Criteria to define the different types of familial gastric cancer syndromes were agreed.
10593993,Foremost among these criteria was that review of histopathology should be part of the evaluation of any family with aggregation of gastric cancer cases.
10593993,Guidelines for genetic testing and counselling in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer were produced.
10593993,"Finally , a proposed strategy for clinical management in families with high penetrance autosomal dominant predisposition to gastric cancer was defined."
11665720,Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer ( HDGC ) is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline mutation of the gene for the cell - to - cell adhesion protein E-cadherin.
11665720,"The syndrome is dominated by predisposition to the histologically diffuse , poorly differentiated form of gastric cancer."
11665720,"It is not associated with intestinal - type gastric cancer , but families may have an elevated risk of lobular breast cancer."
11665720,"Here , we review the identified families , mutations , and proposed mechanisms by which E-cadherin loss promotes tumorigenesis."
27547004,Noncoding RNAs ( ncRNAs ) have attracted much attention in cancer research field.
27547004,"They are involved in cellular development , proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis."
27547004,"The dysregulation of ncRNAs has been reported in tumor initiation , progression , invasion and metastasis in various cancers , including gastric cancer ( GC )."
27547004,"In the past few years , an accumulating body of evidence has deepened our understanding of ncRNAs , and several emerging ncRNAs have been identified , such as PIWI - interacting RNAs ( piRNAs ) and circular RNAs ( circRNAs )."
27547004,"The competing endogenous RNA ( ceRNA ) networks include mRNAs , microRNAs , long ncRNAs ( lncRNAs ) and circRNAs , which play critical roles in the tumorigenesis of GC."
27547004,This review summarizes the recent hotspots of ncRNAs involved in GC pathobiology and their potential applications in GC.
27547004,"Finally , we briefly discuss the advances in the ceRNA network in GC."
25320503,Several new treatment options for gastric cancer have been introduced but the prognosis of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer is still poor.
25320503,Disease prognosis could be improved for high - risk individuals by implementing earlier screenings.
25320503,"Because many patients are asymptomatic during the early stages of gastric cancer , the diagnosis is often delayed and patients present with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease."
25320503,"Cytotoxic treatment has been shown to prolong survival in general , but not all patients are responders."
25320503,The application of targeted therapies and multimodal treatment has improved prognosis for those with advanced disease.
25320503,"However , these new therapeutic strategies do not uniformly benefit all patients."
25320503,Predicting whether patients will respond to specific therapies would be of particular value and would allow for stratifying patients for personalized treatment strategies.
25320503,Metabolic imaging by positron emission tomography was the first technique with the potential to predict the response of esophago - gastric cancer to neoadjuvant therapy.
25320503,Exploring and validating tissue - based biomarkers are ongoing processes.
25320503,"In this review , we discuss the status of several targeted therapies for gastric cancer , as well as proteomic and metabolic methods for investigating biomarkers for therapy response prediction in gastric cancer."
24659868,"Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) plays an important role in gastric carcinogenesis , as the majority of gastric cancers develop from H. pylori - infected gastric mucosa."
24659868,"The rate of early gastric cancer diagnosis has increased in Japan and Korea , where H. pylori infection and gastric cancer are highly prevalent."
24659868,Early intestinal - type gastric cancer without concomitant lymph node metastasis is usually treated by endoscopic resection.
24659868,Secondary metachronous gastric cancers often develop because atrophic mucosa left untreated after endoscopic treatment confers a high risk of gastric cancer.
24659868,The efficacy of H. pylori eradication for the prevention of metachronous gastric cancer remains controversial.
24659868,"However , in patients who undergo endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer , H. pylori eradication is recommended to suppress or delay metachronous gastric cancer."
24659868,Careful and regularly scheduled endoscopy should be performed to detect minute metachronous gastric cancer after endoscopic resection.
16825900,"Gastric cancer affects annually more than 800,000 individuals worldwide and remains a challenge for clinicians and oncologists."
16825900,"Most patients with gastric cancer are diagnosed in advanced stages , when a curative resection is impossible , which leads to an overall poor prognosis."
16825900,"Finding new diagnostic and treatment procedures is of paramount importance to improve patient prognosis , which will be improved most dramatically by techniques that allow the detection of gastric cancer in its early stages."
16825900,"So far the value of conventional tumour markers such as Ca72 - 4 or carcinoembryonic antigen is limited , and even markers developed from molecular biological studies on the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer , such as E-cadherin and others , have not proved to be of adequate sensitivity and specificity to allow the early detection of gastric cancer."
16825900,"With the development of innovative diagnostic tools , such as proteome analysis , new biomarkers may be identified that may allow early diagnosis and thus screening for gastric cancer , particularly in at - risk patient populations."
16825900,Recent studies have indicated that these biomarkers may be derived from the tumour itself or reflect a specific metabolic or immunological response to cancer that can be used to find gastric cancer patients at an early and putatively curative stage of the disease.
24996375,"The prognosis of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer remains poor , despite radical surgical resection."
24996375,"Adjuvant therapy has been shown to improve survival and , in Western countries , is delivered either postoperatively ( chemoradiotherapy ) or perioperatively ( chemotherapy )."
24996375,Debate continues as to which of these represents the optimal strategy.
24996375,"High - dose gastric irradiation comes at the expense of significant toxicity , and increasing efforts have focused on attempts to reduce toxicity and normal tissue doses."
24996375,The development of advancing radiotherapy technologies now allows improved target delineation and coverage.
24996375,"However , gastric irradiation remains technically challenging and requires an understanding of postoperative surgical anatomy , patterns of failure and lymph node drainage , as well as an appreciation of the uncertainties around organ motion and filling."
24996375,"Ongoing trials are examining the optimal strategy in which to incorporate ( chemo ) - radiotherapy , as well as the addition of targeted therapies , in gastric cancer."
24996375,"This overview discusses the current role and evidence for ( chemo ) - radiotherapy , as well as the technical challenges encountered in the radiotherapeutic management of resectable gastric cancer."
19333542,Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infection plays an important role in gastric carcinogenesis.
19333542,We conducted a systematic review concerning gastric cancer development after H. pylori eradication therapy.
19333542,"In total 15 papers matched our criteria , the results were reviewed."
19333542,The H. pylori eradication therapy statistically diminished the prevalence of clinical gastric cancer by approximately one - third.
19333542,"The studies from Japan supported this conclusion ; however , studies from overseas reported conflicting results."
19333542,"The differences in these conclusions lie in the diagnostic ability of endoscopic examination , since the clinical stage was quite different between these studies."
19333542,Gastric cancer that developed after eradication revealed a mainly intestinal type histology and depressed - type appearance.
19333542,"The following are possible reasons for reduced gastric cancer : ( 1 ) eradication therapy inhibits the new occurrence of gastric cancer , ( 2 ) eradication regresses or inhibits the growth of gastric cancer , and ( 3 ) eradication interferes with the discovery of gastric cancer."
19333542,"Considering the biological nature of cancer cell proliferation , a sufficiently long - term follow - up may clarify the effect of eradication therapy on inhibition of the development ( not discovery ) of gastric cancer and reduction of gastric cancer - related mortality."
23599620,"Recent research has shown that microRNA ( miRNA ) , which is involved in almost every step of gastric carcinogenesis , has broad prospective application in diagnosis and therapy of gastric carcinoma."
23599620,"Eastern Asia ( South Korea , Japan and China ) has the highest incidence of gastric cancer in the world."
23599620,"There were 988,000 new cases of gastric cancer worldwide and 736,000 deaths in 2008."
23599620,Approximately 60 % of the cases of gastric cancer are found in East Asia ( mainly China ).
23599620,"We herein provide a brief review of the clinical applications of miRNA , which include the following aspects : ( 1 ) miRNA may serve as a potential new generation of tumor markers ; ( 2 ) a complete miRNA expression profile is highly specific , can reflect the evolutionary lineage and differentiation of tumors , and be used to carry out diversity analysis ; ( 3 ) detecting specific miRNA expression in peripheral blood will become a new method for diagnosis of gastric cancer ; ( 4 ) miRNA can predict prognosis of gastric cancer ; ( 5 ) miRNA has predictive value in determining chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance ; and ( 6 ) miRNA could be a type of innovative drug."
23599620,"Finally , we focus on assessing the value of miRNA from laboratory to clinical application and the challenges it faces in East Asia."
17577615,There are geographic and ethnic differences in the incidence of gastric cancer around the world as well as with its trends for each population over time.
17577615,The incidence patterns observed among immigrants change according to where they live.
17577615,All of these factors serve to indicate the close association of gastric cancer with modifiable factors such as diet.
17577615,This review presents epidemiological evidence on the association between dietary factors and gastric cancer based on previous systematic reviews and subsequent updates.
17577615,Infection with Helicobacter pylori is a strong and established risk factor of gastric cancer but is not a sufficient cause for its development.
17577615,"Substantial evidence from ecological , case - control , and cohort studies strongly suggests that the risk may be increased with a high intake of various traditional salt - preserved foods and salt per se and decreased with a high intake of fruit and vegetables , particularly fruit."
17577615,"However , it remains unclear which constituents in fruit and vegetables play a significant role in gastric cancer prevention."
17577615,"Among them , vitamin C is a plausible candidate supported by a relatively large body of epidemiological evidence."
17577615,"Consumption of green tea is possibly associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer , although the protective effects have been , for the most part , identified in Japanese women , most of whom are nonsmokers."
17577615,"In contrast , processed meat and N - nitroso compounds may be positively associated with the risk of gastric cancer."
17577615,"In conclusion , dietary modification by reducing salt and salted food intake , as well as by increasing intake of fruit and vitamin C , represents a practical strategy to prevent gastric cancer."
16154715,"Despite its decreasing frequency in the Western world during recent decades , gastric cancer is still one of the leading causes of cancer - related deaths worldwide."
16154715,"Due to the oligosymptomatic course of early gastric cancer , most cases are diagnosed in the advanced stages of the disease."
16154715,"The curative potential of current standard treatment continues to be unsatisfactory , despite multimodal approaches involving surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy."
16154715,"Novel therapeutics including small molecules and monoclonal antibodies are being developed and have been partially introduced into clinical use in connection with neoplastic diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma and colorectal cancer."
16154715,Thorough understanding of the changes in gene expression occurring during gastric carcinogenesis may help to develop targeted therapies and improve the treatment of this disease.
16154715,"Novel molecular biology techniques have generated a wealth of data on up - and down - regulation , activation and inhibition of specific pathways in gastric cancer."
16154715,"Here , we provide an overview of the different aspects of aberrant gene expression patterns in gastric cancer."
26315523,"Low ratio of mortality over incidence of gastric cancer in Asian countries including Korea and Japan could be explained by early detection after screening , different treatment strategy , or genetic disparity between the East and West."
26315523,Early detection after screening program for gastric cancer and subsequent surgical treatment including appropriate lymph node dissection has been developed successfully in high risk areas such as East Asian countries.
26315523,"Even in countries with a low prevalence of gastric cancer , a specific screening program is recommended for any high - risk population."
16825897,The prognosis of gastric cancer is closely related to the stage of disease at diagnosis.
16825897,"Early gastric cancer , whereby disease is limited to mucosa and submucosa , confers a survival rate of greater than 90 % in 5 years in many centres."
16825897,Gastric cancer is still a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide.
16825897,"In high incidence areas such as Japan , screening of asymptomatic population has been advocated."
16825897,"However , in Western countries , mass screening is not cost - effective."
16825897,"Hence , strategy has been directed to screen symptomatic individuals who are at higher risk of gastric cancer."
16825897,Most patients with early gastric cancer present with symptoms indistinguishable from benign peptic ulcer disease.
16825897,Screening for this group of patients improves detection rate of early gastric cancer and therefore its prognosis.
16825897,Endoscopy for surveillance of premalignant lesions has been explored with this objective in mind.
16825897,"Serology testing for biomarkers such as pepsinogen , anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody and gastrin has been studied as an alternative to endoscopy."
16825897,"There is compelling evidence for the role of H. pylori in the initiation of Correa 's cascade ( stepwise progression from chronic active gastritis , atrophic gastritis , intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia and finally adenocarcinoma )."
16825897,Regression of premalignant lesions has been demonstrated with H. pylori eradication.
16825897,"However , it is not known whether this might effectively prevent gastric cancer in either low or high - risk population."
16015679,Gastric carcinoma remains a common disease worldwide with a dismal prognosis.
16015679,"Therefore , it represents a very important health problem."
16015679,It occurs with a high incidence in Asia and is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the world.
16015679,"Although the incidence and mortality of gastric carcinoma are decreasing in many countries , gastric cancer still represents the second most frequent malignancies in the world and the fourth in Europe."
16015679,The 5 - year survival rate of gastric carcinoma is low.
16015679,The etiology and pathogenesis are not yet fully known.
16015679,The study of gastric cancer is important in clinical medicine as well as in public health.
16015679,"Over the past 15 years , integrated research in molecular pathology has clarified the details of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities of cancer - related genes in the course of the development and progression of gastric cancer."
16015679,"Gastric cancer , as all cancers , is the end result of the interplay of many risk factors as well as protective factors."
16015679,"Although epidemiological evidence indicates that environmental factors play a major role in gastric carcinogenesis , the role of immunological , genetic , and immunogenetic factors are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma."
16015679,"Among the environmental factors , diet and Helicobacter pylori are more amenable to intervention aimed at the prevention of gastric cancer."
16015679,The aim of the present paper is to review and include the most recent published evidence to demonstrate that only a multidisciplinary approach will lead to the advancement of the pathogenesis and prevention of gastric cancer.
16015679,On the immunogenetic research it is clear that evidence is accumulating to suggest that a genetic profile favoring the proinflammatory response increases the risk of gastric carcinoma.
8045028,Radical dissection for gastric cancer is not widely practiced in the West.
8045028,This paper reviews the evidence in support of lymphadenectomy and the techniques of radical resection as practiced by Japanese surgeons.
8045028,We believe the published results support increased use of radical surgery in the treatment of gastric cancer and would recommend further adoption of this technique as there is minimal associated morbidity.
25278684,"Gastric cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide , and is especially prevalent in Asian countries."
25278684,"With such high morbidity and mortality , early diagnosis is essential to achieving curative intent treatment and long term survival."
25278684,Metabolomics is a new field of study that analyzes metabolites from biofluids and tissue samples.
25278684,"While metabolomics is still in its infancy , there are numerous potential applications in oncology , specifically early diagnosis."
25278684,Only a few studies in the literature have examined metabolomics ' role in gastric cancer.
25278684,"Various fatty acid , carbohydrate , nucleic acid , and amino acid metabolites have been identified that distinguish gastric cancer from normal tissue and benign gastric disease."
25278684,"However , findings from these few studies are at times conflicting."
25278684,"Most studies demonstrate some relationship of cancer cells to the Warburg Effect , in that glycolysis predominates with conversion of pyruvate to lactate."
25278684,This is one of the most consistent findings across the literature.
25278684,"There is less consistency in metabolomic signature with respect to nucleic acids , lipids and amino acids."
25278684,"In spite of this , metabolomics holds some promise for cancer surveillance but further studies are necessary to achieve consistency and validation before it can be widely employed as a clinical tool."
12590229,A close link has been established between infection and gastric cancer.
12590229,"In this article , we suggest that using a risk stratification technique ( like that for colorectal cancer ) , the high - risk group of first - degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer can be separated out for testing and treatment."
12590229,"This would be more manageable and more cost - effective than screening the whole population , in which the mortality from distal gastric cancer has declined concomitant with the eradication of infection."
12590229,"Support for the feasibility of this approach is derived from studies showing that the family is the core unit of transmission and that childhood colonization , especially with a virulent strain , is apparently a major risk factor for disease progression to the neoplastic stage."
12590229,"When there is a case of gastric cancer in the family , first - degree relatives , who might be infected by a bacterium with an identical genetic fingerprint , are at higher risk than normal for developing gastric cancer."
12590229,"Furthermore , genetic and epidemiologic studies based on the Correa model have shown that both primary and secondary prevention of gastric cancer is possible."
12590229,"Calculations done in high - risk populations , such as Japanese - Americans , confirm the savings in cost and the safety of the test - and - treat strategy."
12590229,"Considering that eradication should be done as early as possible , at a point in the cascade when the changes are still reversible , and that gastric cancer is associated with a high mortality rate , we suggest that this strategy be applied to this high - risk population."
20820982,Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer - related death worldwide.
20820982,"Surgery is the only curative therapy for localized gastric cancer , but the extent of regional lymphadenectomy has been a matter of considerable debate."
20820982,"Extended resections that are regarded as standard procedures in some Asian countries , including Japan and Korea , have not been shown to be as effective in Western countries."
20820982,The extent of lymphadenectomy for advanced gastric cancer has been studied in many prospective randomized controlled trials.
20820982,"On the other hand , patients with early gastric cancer have an excellent survival rate ( > 90 % ) after radical surgery."
20820982,Lymph node metastasis from early gastric cancer is relatively infrequent.
20820982,"Therefore , it might be practical to perform less invasive surgery for early gastric cancer."
20820982,"In this review article , we examine the evidence for lymph node dissection as radical surgery in advanced gastric cancer and the possibility of limited resection for early gastric cancer."
18070698,"Although radical surgical R0 resections are the basis of cure for gastric cancer , surgery alone only provides long - term survival in 20 - 30 % of patients with advanced - stage disease."
18070698,"Thus , in Western and European countries , advanced gastric cancer has a high risk of recurrence and metachronous metastases."
18070698,"Very recently , multimodal strategies combining different neoadjuvant and / or adjuvant protocols have improved the prognosis of gastric cancer when combined with surgery with curative intent."
18070698,"As used in palliative regimens , the combination of cisplatin with intravenous or oral fluoropyrimidines has been the integral component of such ( neo ) adjuvant strategies."
18070698,"However , the cytotoxic agents docetaxel , oxaliplatin and irinotecan and new targeted biologicals such as cetuximab , bevacizumab or panitumumab are currently under investigation , with or without irradiation , in multimodal treatment regimens."
18070698,"These studies may further increase R0 resection rates , and prolong disease - free and overall survival times in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer."
18070698,"This article reviews the most relevant literature on multimodal treatment of gastric cancer , and discusses future strategies to improve locoregional failures."
29045948,Objectives : This study aimed to investigate the validity of gastric cancer surgery in elderly patients.
29045948,"Methods : A total of 544 patients who underwent elective gastrectomy for gastric cancer were divided into an elderly group ( age ≥ 75 years , n = 171 ) and a control group ( age < 75 years , n = 373 )."
29045948,The clinicopathological data of the patients were reviewed.
29045948,"Results : The overall morbidity rate ( 26.3 vs. 16.1 % , p = 0.005 ) and the incidence rate of anastomotic leakage ( 6.4 vs. 1.6 % , p = 0.003 ) were significantly higher in the elderly group."
29045948,"The proportion of patients who had severe complications ( ≥ grade IIIa ) was relatively higher in the elderly group ( 10.5 vs. 5.7 % ) ; however , the difference was not significant ( p = 0.074 )."
29045948,A stage - matched survival analysis revealed no significant differences between the groups ( stage I : p = 0.978 ; stage II : p = 0.964 ; stage III : p = 0.199 ).
29045948,"For the pathological stages II and III , the overall survival of the patients in the elderly group who received adjuvant chemotherapy for > 3 months was significantly better than that of the patients who received it for ≤ 3 months or did not receive it ( p = 0.023 )."
29045948,Conclusions : An aggressive treatment strategy should be adopted in selected elderly patients with gastric cancer.
19712167,"In spite of important new insights into the basic mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis , progress in the management of gastric cancer has been modest."
19712167,Some modifications in the chemotherapies used for palliation and strategies for downstaging of the disease prior to surgical intervention are noteworthy.
19712167,The positive experience with endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) and submucosal dissection ( ESD ) for treatment of early gastric cancer has been confirmed and extended.
19712167,The procedure - related morbidity and post-interventional quality of life is clearly favorable compared to open surgical resection in well - selected patients.
19712167,New data on Helicobacter pylori revealed that eradication after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer significantly reduces the incidence of recurrent and metachronous gastric neoplasias.
19712167,It can further improve healing rates of treatment induced gastric ulcers.
19712167,Eradication therapy therefore remains the best target for prevention of the disease.
19712167,"Critical is the "" point of no return "" when mucosal alterations ( i.e. intestinal metaplasia , glandular atrophy ) are no longer reversible."
19712167,A population - based screen - and - eradicate strategy for H. pylori infection can at present only be recommended in high incidence regions.
3768650,"From 1975 to 1985 , 142 patients with early gastric cancer were operated on in our service ; this group comprised 14 per cent of all patients with gastric cancer operated on during this period."
3768650,Epigastric pain was the most frequent symptom ( 75.3 per cent ).
3768650,"The lesions were located in the lower third in 45.8 per cent , in the middle third in 31.7 per cent , in the upper third in 20.4 per cent and in the gastric stump in 2.1 per cent."
3768650,Subtotal gastrectomy was performed in 116 patients and operative mortality was limited to two patients.
3768650,"Macroscopically 86.6 per cent of cases were included in type III , IIc and IIc - III."
3768650,"The five year survival rate , excluding the operative mortality , was 93.1 per cent."
3768650,"Tumours located in the lower third of the stomach , limited to the mucosa and of ulcerating type , had the best prognosis."
15864714,The prognosis after surgical treatment of gastric cancer remains poor.
15864714,This review aims to clarify the indication for multimodal treatment of gastric cancer.
15864714,A systematic literature research and evaluation of clinical data presented at important international cancer meetings were undertaken.
15864714,Recently published results of large randomized phase III trials underscore the potential value of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in gastric cancer.
15864714,"However , data from randomized controlled trials are still scarce , and it remains uncertain which subgroups of patients should routinely undergo multimodal treatment."
15864714,"In view of the side effects of pre - and foremost postoperative therapies , a more distinct definition of prognostic and predictive markers is warranted."
15864714,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a rising option in locally advanced gastric cancer.
15864714,Adjuvant chemoradiation has been shown to be beneficial in gastric cancer patients who have undergone suboptimal surgical resection.
15864714,The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy alone seem to be very small.
15297947,The curative management of gastric adenocarcinoma depends upon complete resection of the primary tumor.
15297947,"In patients with lymph node metastases in the resected specimen , the relapse and death rates from recurrent cancer are at least 70 % to 80 %."
15297947,There is continued debate over whether more extensive lymph node dissection ( D2 ) improves survival when compared to less extensive operations.
15297947,"Until recently , attempts at preventing recurrence have employed adjuvant chemotherapy and have been ineffective."
15297947,"A large US Intergroup study ( INT - 0116 ) demonstrated that combined chemoradiation following complete gastric resection improves median time to relapse ( 30 v 19 months , P < .0001 ) and overall survival ( 35 months v 28 months , P = .01 )."
15297947,The improvements in disease - free and overall survival created by postoperative chemoradiation have defined a new standard of care.
15297947,"Also the publication of a large phase III neoadjuvant chemotherapy clinical trial using epirubicin , cisplatin , and 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) suggested that this technique may downstage tumors and increase resectability."
15297947,Future advances in the therapy of resectable gastric cancer may come from studies of preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation and the application of targeted therapies such as growth receptor antagonists and antiangiogenesis agents.
18257608,The management of gastric cancer remains a challenge.
18257608,"In recent years , the most important advances have been achieved in the adjuvant setting for patients with locally advanced disease , where significant survival benefits have been demonstrated for both perioperative chemotherapy and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy."
18257608,These findings have changed the standard of care for patients with resectable disease.
18257608,"In the setting of metastatic gastric cancer , the development of new cytotoxic regimens must consider the balance between efficacy and toxicity in patients whose overall prognosis is poor."
18257608,"Major advances in recent years include the development of orally administered fluoropyrimidine analogues , which can be used in place of intravenous fluorouracil , and the addition of newer agents such as oxaliplatin and docetaxel , which have demonstrated efficacy in patients with advanced disease."
18257608,"Targeted therapies have had a major impact on the management of certain malignancies , and while their evaluation in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer remains early , it is likely that these agents will continue to be developed and studied in combination with chemotherapy."
18257608,This article reviews recent advances in the use of chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer.
18257608,"Targeted therapies , their mechanisms of action and emerging data supporting their use in gastric cancer are also discussed."
18257608,"The two randomized phase III trials supporting adjuvant therapy for locally advanced , resectable gastric cancer are discussed in detail , together with strategies for future trials in this area."
18257608,"Overall , there remains optimism that further incremental gains will be achieved with future studies combining chemotherapy , radiotherapy and targeted therapies , both in the adjuvant and metastatic disease settings."
28800316,Background : An overwhelming amount of evidence has emerged suggesting that dysregulated microRNAs ( miRNAs ) play crucial roles in tumorigenesis.
28800316,Objective : The study was to analyze tissue / serum miR - 144 expression in gastric cancer and then evaluate their potential to predict the prognosis of gastric cancer.
28800316,Methods : We examined miR - 144 levels in tissues and peripheral blood samples from 96 gastric cancer patients using real - time PCR.
28800316,Then the association between tissue / serum miR - 144 levels and clinicopathological parameters was determined.
28800316,Results : The expression levels of miR - 144 were significantly down - regulated in the cancerous tissue and serum samples from gastric cancer patients.
28800316,Serum miR - 144 was able to differentiate the gastric cancer patients from healthy controls with high accuracy.
28800316,"In addition , tissue and serum miR - 144 levels were both associated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis."
28800316,"Moreover , patients with lower tissue or serum miR - 144 suffered worse 5 year overall survival and disease free survival."
28800316,"Conclusions : Taken together , our data support the potential clinical value of tissue and serum miR - 144 as prognostic biomarkers in gastric cancer."
27514667,Background : Gastric cancer is an aggressive disease with a poor 5 - year survival and large global burden of disease.
27514667,The disease is biologically and genetically heterogeneous with a poorly understood carcinogenesis at the molecular level.
27514667,"Despite the many prognostic , predictive , and therapeutic biomarkers investigated to date , gastric cancer continues to be detected at an advanced stage with resultant poor clinical outcomes."
27514667,"Main body : This is a global review of gastric biomarkers with an emphasis on HER2 , E-cadherin , fibroblast growth factor receptor , mammalian target of rapamycin , and hepatocyte growth factor receptor as well as sections on microRNAs , long noncoding RNAs , matrix metalloproteinases , PD - L1 , TP53 , and microsatellite instability."
27514667,"Conclusion : A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis and biological features of gastric cancer , including the identification and characterization of diagnostic , prognostic , predictive , and therapeutic biomarkers , hopefully will provide improved clinical outcomes."
27461616,Objective : To explore the correlation between ROBO2 and RASSF2A gene methylations and gastric cancer family history.
27461616,Materials and methods : ROBO2 and RASSF2A gene methylations in gastric cancer tissues and peri.cancerous tissues were detected with methylation.specific PCR in 36.
27461616,patients with gastric cancer family history and 33 without gastric cancer family history.
27461616,"The correlations of ROBO2 and RASSF2A gene methylations with family history , and clinical and pathological characteristics were analyzed."
27461616,Results : ROBO2 and RASSF2A gene methylations were all significantly higher in gastric cancer tissues ( 30 % and 26 % ) than in peri-cancerous tissues ( 0 % and 0 % ) ( all P < 0.05 ).
27461616,"ROBO2 gene methylation was significantly lower in the patients with gastric cancer family history ( 17 % , 6/36 ) than in the patients without gastric cancer family history ( 41 % , 15/33 ) ( P < 0.05 )."
27461616,"Conclusion : ROBO2 and RASSF2A gene methylations may be related to gastric tumorigenesis , and ROBO2 gene methylation is associated with sporadic gastric cancer."
11512601,Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
11512601,"Most patients with gastric cancer present with locally advanced and incurable disease , and overall survival is poor."
11512601,Considerable research efforts towards the epidemiology and pathogenesis of gastric cancer have not been translated into treatment success.
11512601,"We discuss current concepts of the pathogenesis of gastric cancer and how recent research advances , in particular global gene expression strategies , may improve this understanding , and suggest a framework wherein these approaches may be used."
20870917,"Epidemiology : Gastric cancer is the second most common cancer in Asia , more than half of the world 's gastric cancer cases arise in Eastern Asia , and the majority of Asia 's cases still occur in the distal part of the stomach."
20870917,"Etiology and prevention : The etiology of gastric cancer consists of genetic susceptibility , Helicobacter pylori infection and environmental risk factors."
20870917,"Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment , consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits and use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs seem to reduce the risk of gastric cancer."
20870917,Endoscopy and diagnosis : Screening for gastric cancer is cost - effective in countries with high incidence.
20870917,Risk stratification may increase the cost - effectiveness of screening in populations at moderate risk.
20870917,Endoscopic resection is curative in a subset of patients with early cancer.
20870917,Surgery and adjuvant treatment : R0 resection with D2 lymph node dissection has produced the best survival data.
20870917,Some kind of post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy including S - 1 is recommended after D2 surgery.
20870917,"Chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer : As chemotherapy for gastric cancer , fluorouracils plus platinum are the most widely accepted first - line regimens , whereas taxanes or irinotecan are mostly used in second - and third - line settings."
20870917,Differences in the approval and medical insurance systems may influence the status of these regimens.
20870917,Trastuzumab in combination with fluorouracils / platinum will be a standard regimen for HER2 - positive gastric cancer.
20870917,"Many new targeting agents are currently under investigation , and Asian countries are playing important roles in investigation and development of new and better treatments for this malignancy."
11821789,Background : Biological characteristics of gastric cancer depend mostly on genetic alterations in the cancer cells of individuals.
11821789,"To precisely predict the biological behavior and clinical outcome of individual cancer , it may be important to clarify the DNA profiles of cancer cells in each case."
11821789,Methods : We have reviewed the most important results of studies on DNA ploidy of gastric cancer published in the English literature during the last 2 decades.
11821789,"Results : Gastric carcinoma with aneuploidy has been shown to have a high proliferative activity and a high metastatic or invasive potential , thus leading to a poor prognosis as compared to diploid tumors."
11821789,"Conclusion : Analyses of DNA ploidy in gastric cancer may provide clinically useful information on diagnostic , therapeutic , and prognostic aspects."
11821789,Further investigations may be needed to clarify the relationship between chromosome instability and DNA ploidy.
17229238,"Background : Helicobacter pylori is recognized as one of the most significant risk factors for gastric cancer , and H. pylori eradication has been proposed as a possible primary chemo - preventive strategy to reduce gastric cancer incidence."
17229238,Aim : To evaluate the available evidence on the efficacy of H. pylori eradication in the prevention of gastric cancer.
17229238,"Methods : Epidemiological , observational and interventional studies , as well as decisional models , were taken into account in this review."
17229238,Results : Large - scale epidemiological studies clearly link H. pylori infection with non-cardia gastric cancer.
17229238,"Current evidence suggests that , in a subpopulation of treated subjects , H. pylori eradication prevents the progression of preneoplastic lesions."
17229238,Studies that have attempted to evaluate the effect of H. pylori eradication on the incidence of gastric cancer have not provided definitive answers.
17229238,H. pylori eradication seems to reduce the incidence of gastric cancer in patients without baseline precancerous gastric lesions.
17229238,"Decisional models suggest that H. pylori screening could be cost - effective , but there is not yet sufficient evidence to support the setting up of a general screening programme."
17229238,"Conclusion : Helicobacter pylori eradication is a plausible intervention for gastric cancer prevention ; however , it seems to be relevant in only a subset of subjects."
17249273,The prognosis of early gastric cancer ( EGC ) is excellent worldwide.
17249273,"Incidence of EGC shows considerable geographic variation , and in high prevalence areas where diagnostic skills are adept , EGCs are not frequently overlooked."
17249273,"In these countries , less invasive , function - preserving treatments such as endoscopic mucosal resection and pylorus - preserving gastrectomy have become standard options."
17249273,The criteria to apply conservative treatments are being expanded along with the technological improvement.
17249273,"Though its natural history is relatively long , EGC could be a fatal disease and should be carefully treated."
17249273,Lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor that should be considered in treatment selection and follow - up planning of EGC.
21088411,The majority of gastric adenocarcinomas are related to chronic inflammation induced by Helicobacter pylori infection.
21088411,"For intestinal - type gastric cancer , a multistep process of mucosal alterations leading from gastritis via glandular atrophy , intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia to invasive carcinoma is well recognized."
21088411,Ongoing clinical studies focus on a ' point of no return '.
21088411,It is defined as a situation when certain alterations are no longer reversible by H. pylori eradication and progression to gastric cancer may continue.
21088411,H. pylori affects the mucosal as well as the systemic immune response by secretion of cytokines and the recruitment of distinct inflammatory cells.
21088411,The immune response is characterized by a balance between a Th1 - dominated response and the recruitment of antigen - specific regulatory T cells that allow the bacteria to persist in human gastric mucosa.
21088411,"Besides immune - mediated effects , H. pylori induces cellular alterations as well as genetic alterations in genes that are essential for the epigenetic integrity and mucosal homeostasis."
21088411,These genetic alterations during gastric cancer development are in focus of intensive research and should ultimately allow the identification of risk factors involved in gastric carcinogenesis.
21088411,The detection of individuals at high risk for gastric cancer would help to design appropriate strategies for prevention and surveillance.
19147324,Background : Gastric cancer is fourth on the incidence list of cancers worldwide with a high disease - related mortality rate.
19147324,Curation can only be achieved by a radical resection including an adequate lymphadenectomy.
19147324,"However , prognosis remains poor and cancer recurrence rates are high , also due to lymph node metastases."
19147324,"To improve outcome , ( neo ) adjuvant treatment strategies with chemo - and / or radiotherapy regimes are employed."
19147324,Aims : Accurate staging of gastric cancer at primary diagnosis is essential for adequate treatment.
19147324,In this non-systematic review the role 18 - F - Fluoro -2-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) in preoperative staging is investigated.
19147324,"Furthermore , the results of neoadjuvant chemotherapy - induced tumour response monitoring by FDG - PET are discussed."
19147324,Results and conclusion : It is concluded that currently FDG - PET has no role in the primary detection of gastric cancer due to its low sensitivity.
19147324,"FDG - PET shows , however , slightly better results in the evaluation of lymph node metastases in gastric cancer compared to CT and could have therefore a role in the preoperative staging."
19147324,"Improvement in accuracy could be achieved by using PET / CT or other PET tracers than FDG , but these modalities need further investigation."
19147324,"FDG - PET , however , adequately detects therapy responders at an early stage following neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
28618420,Gastric cancer ( GC ) represents a global health concern.
28618420,"Despite advances in prevention , diagnosis , and therapy , GC is still the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide , with more than 720,000 estimated deaths in 2012."
28618420,"Overall survival for advanced disease is about 1 year , a dismal prognosis that is partly due to the high levels of biological heterogeneity found in GC."
28618420,"Indeed , GC is a highly heterogeneous disease from morphological and molecular standpoints."
28618420,The numerous histological and molecular classifications currently available reflect such heterogeneity.
28618420,"Although recent high - throughput studies cluster the molecular data obtained into subgroups with clinical relevance , we still need a practical , prognostic , and predictive classification system , integrating morphological and molecular features , towards the identification of novel therapeutic targets."
28618420,"It is noteworthy that GC heterogeneity encompasses not only interpatient variability ( intertumour heterogeneity ) , but also variations within the same tumour ( intratumour heterogeneity )."
28618420,The latter encompasses spatial heterogeneity ( in different tumour areas ) and temporal heterogeneity ( along progression from primary to recurrent and / or metastatic disease ).
28618420,"In this review , we analyse the morphological , immunophenotypic , and molecular heterogeneity in GC as the basis for a better understanding of the disease , and discuss the practical implications for diagnostic pathology , prognostic evaluation , and precision therapy."
25387321,Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of mortality in rich countries and today it has the same meaning for health care as the epidemics of past centuries had for medicine in earlier times : 50 % of the population in these countries die of cardiovascular disease.
25387321,The amount of cardiovascular disease is also increasing in the developing countries together with economic growth.
25387321,By 2015 one in three deaths will globally be due to cardiovascular diseases.
25387321,"Coronary heart disease is a chronic disease that starts in childhood , even if the symptoms first occur in the middle age."
25387321,"The risks for coronary heart disease are well - known : lipid disorders , especially high serum LDL - cholesterol concentration , high blood pressure , tobacco smoking , obesity , diabetes , male gender and physical inactivity."
25387321,Obesity is both an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease but is also closely connected with several other risk factors.
25387321,This review focuses on the connection between overweight or obesity and cardiovascular disease.
29473518,Aim : To summarize the main findings on variable cardiovascular risk factors and their management in everyday practice.
29473518,Methods : A narrative review of the relevant literature known to the authors and incorporation of healthy changes tips in defined variable cardiovascular risk factors.
29473518,Results : There are known variable cardiovascular risk factors to be claimed as those that should be changed in order to achieve a better prevention of cardiovascular disease development.
29473518,"But , most papers are informative and they did n't incorporate exact measures for each variable risk factor."
29473518,Our paper shows exact measures for each variable cardiovascular risk factor that should be incorporate in everyday practice of family practitioners and cardiologists as well.
29473518,Conclusion : The best cardiovascular disease ' prevention should include a multidisciplinary team of experts and the entire community with the support of governmental and non-governmental organizations that will contribute to improving the lifestyle of individuals and the entire community through their activities and legal provisions.
29473518,"The most important factors in cardiovascular disease management are : recognizing individual risk factors , monitoring them , and assisting in changes in life - style habits that directly affect the defined risk factors of a patient."
29473518,"The simplest and most practicable guidelines for CV prevention in accordance with the national , cultural and socioeconomic aspects of their country of work are needed."
29744010,Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women worldwide.
29744010,The pathophysiological basis of cardiovascular health among men and women is not identical.
29744010,"This leads to variable cardiovascular responses to stimulus and presentation of cardiovascular disease symptoms , both of which can have a direct effect on treatment outcomes."
29744010,"Traditionally , the enrollment of women in clinical trials has been minimal , resulting in a lack of gender - specific analysis of clinical trial data and , therefore , the absence of concrete risk factor assessment among women."
29744010,"However , scientific progress in the past decade has identified a spectrum of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases that may be specific to women."
29744010,"These risk factors , which may include menopause , hypertensive disease of pregnancy , and depression , confer additional risk in women besides the traditional risk factors."
29744010,The current state of knowledge and awareness about these risk factors is suboptimal at this time.
29744010,"Therefore , although the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is similar in both genders , appropriate risk stratification may be limited in women compared to men."
29744010,"The purpose of this review is to describe the recent trends in identifying female - specific risk factors for cardiovascular diseases , their utility in risk stratification , and current pharmacological options for women with regard to cardiovascular disease prevention."
25176558,Cardiovascular diseases remain the first killer in the Western countries.
25176558,"Equivalent contributions of prevention initiatives , pharmaceutical developments and technological improvements have led to an important success in the reduction of mortality related to cardiovascular diseases in some of the countries of the Western world."
25176558,"However , increase in life expectance , incomplete adherence to guidelines , difficulties in convincing governments and the population to support and adhere to prevention measures make that the burden of cardiovascular diseases is still extremely high."
25176558,This review gives a restricted summary of the most important prevention guidelines supported by the European Society of Cardiology.
25176558,It also illustrates the still very incomplete adherence to these guidelines in the different European countries as published in the EUROASPIRE surveys.
29406939,Cardiovascular disease in women as a distinct disease entity is underappreciated relative to other female - specific diseases.
29406939,A perception that cardiovascular disease affects men more commonly and a lack of understanding about the underlying pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in women contribute to this phenomenon.
29406939,"Hormonal changes , pregnancy - related conditions , and cancer therapies have an impact on endothelial function , vascular anatomy , and myocardial contractility."
29406939,"Women with heart disease often present later , receive care not consistent with accepted guidelines , and have less access to diagnostic and therapeutic resources."
29406939,Understanding the differences and challenges of treating cardiovascular disease in women is essential to improving population health.
30150419,"Cardiovascular disease is the prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in the world , affecting many millions of individuals every year."
30150419,"Atherosclerosis , a chronic inflammatory condition that involves different cell types , several cytokines and adhesion molecules , is the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease."
30150419,"Vitamin D is known to control skeletal patho / physiology , regulating calcium and phosphorus and bone remodeling along with other calcium - regulating hormones."
30150419,"However , several active metabolites of vitamin D can exert both direct action , mainly via vitamin D3 receptor trans - activation and indirect actions on several other tissues by an endocrine , autocrine and paracrine manners."
30150419,"With regard to cardiovascular disease , vitamin D deficiency has been associated with activation of the pro-inflammatory mechanism , promoting atherogenesis."
30150419,"There are several large - scale clinical studies , as well as meta - analyses that support this finding."
30150419,"However , it is still unclear whether the plasma 25 - hydroxyvitamin D level can be used as a biomarker for future cardiovascular disease."
30150419,Herein we review the studies reporting a causative role for vitamin D in cardiovascular disease.
30385177,Traditional cardiovascular risk factors do not underlie all incidence of cardiovascular disease.
30385177,"In recent years , accumulating evidence has demonstrated that gut microbiota and its metabolites also play a pivotal role in the onset and development of cardiovascular disease , including atherosclerosis , hypertension , heart failure , atrial fibrillation and myocardial fibrosis."
30385177,"Trillions of bacteria indwell the gastrointestinal tract and metabolize nutrients into trimethylamine - N - oxide , short - chain fatty acids and so on."
30385177,Targeting these microorganisms and relevant metabolic pathways has beneficial effects in cardiovascular disease.
30385177,"This review will summarize the role of gut microbiota and its metabolites , mainly trimethylamine - N - oxide , in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases , and discuss the possible mechanisms that drive cardiovascular diseases and highlight potential therapies in this field."
30341894,"Circular RNA ( circRNA ) are endogenous transcripts that display differential expression across species , developmental stages , and pathologies."
30341894,"Their lack of free ends confers increased stability when compared with linear transcripts , making them ideal candidates for future diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic interventions."
30341894,Increasing evidence has implicated circRNA in the pathogenesis of multiple cardiovascular diseases.
30341894,"In this paper , we summarize current understanding of circRNA biogenesis , properties , expression profiles , detection methods , functions , and their implication in cardiac pathologies including / ischemia reperfusion injury , myocardial infarction , cardiac senescence , cardiac fibrosis , cardiomyopathy , cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure , atherosclerosis , coronary artery disease , and aneurysm."
28860319,"In this second part of a 2 - part series on the global burden of cardiovascular disease , we review the proven , effective approaches to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease."
28860319,"We specifically review the management of acute cardiovascular diseases , including acute coronary syndromes and stroke ; the care of cardiovascular disease in the ambulatory setting , including medical strategies for vascular disease , atrial fibrillation , and heart failure ; surgical strategies for arterial revascularization , rheumatic and other valvular heart disease , and symptomatic bradyarrhythmia ; and approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular disease , including lifestyle factors , blood pressure control , cholesterol - lowering , antithrombotic therapy , and fixed - dose combination therapy."
28860319,We also discuss cardiovascular disease prevention in diabetes mellitus ; digital health interventions ; the importance of socioeconomic status and universal health coverage.
28860319,"We review building capacity for conduction cardiovascular intervention through strengthening healthcare systems , priority setting , and the role of cost effectiveness."
29725935,"Trillions of microbes inhabit the human gut , not only providing nutrients and energy to the host from the ingested food , but also producing metabolic bioactive signaling molecules to maintain health and elicit disease , such as cardiovascular disease ( CVD )."
29725935,CVD is the leading cause of mortality worldwide.
29725935,"In this review , we presented gut microbiota derived metabolites involved in cardiovascular health and disease , including trimethylamine - N - oxide ( TMAO ) , uremic toxins , short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) , phytoestrogens , anthocyanins , bile acids and lipopolysaccharide."
29725935,"These gut microbiota derived metabolites play critical roles in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular function , and if dysregulated , potentially causally linked to CVD."
29725935,A better understanding of the function and dynamics of gut microbiota derived metabolites holds great promise toward mechanistic predicative CVD biomarker discoveries and precise interventions.
26972035,"Inadequate sleep is increasingly pervasive , and the impact on health remains to be fully understood."
26972035,The cardiovascular consequences alone appear to be substantial.
26972035,This review summarizes epidemiologic evidence regarding the association between extremes of sleep duration and the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular diseases.
26972035,"The adverse effects of experimental sleep loss on physiological functions are discussed , along with cardiovascular risk factors that may underlie the association with increased morbidity and mortality."
26972035,Current data support the concept that inadequate sleep duration confers heightened cardiovascular risk.
26972035,Thus implementation of preventative strategies may reduce the potential disease burden associated with this high - risk behavior.
28338521,Purpose of review : The prevalence of cardiovascular disease differs among ethnic groups and along geographic boundaries.
28338521,"At present , most of the projected increase in mortality from cardiovascular disease occurs in sub-Saharan African , Chinese and Southeast Asian populations."
28338521,Ethnic disparities in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease coincide with quantitative and qualitative differences in risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
28338521,High plasma cholesterol is one of the most important preventable causes of ischemic heart disease.
28338521,Recent findings : The current review summarizes recent evidence on ethnic differences in ischemic heart disease and its correlates with genetic and acquired differences in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels.
28338521,"The nature of ethnic differences in plasma lipid levels , apolipoprotein L1 en lipoprotein ( a ) [ Lp ( a ) ] is outlined , and the effects of lipid - lowering therapy and future efforts and challenges regarding implementation are discussed."
28338521,"Summary : Ethnic differences in HDL - cholesterol ( HDL - C ) , triglyceride levels and Lp ( a ) may impact ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease and result in higher residual risk during lipid - lowering therapy."
28338521,Further efforts should be made to stimulate the use of statins in both high - income and low - income countries and study their effects in individuals with different ethnic backgrounds.
25809518,"Patients with major depression are at an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease , respond more poorly to treatment , and exhibit worse outcomes , including increased morbidity and mortality."
25809518,"This article reviews the relationship between depression and heart disease , with an emphasis on epidemiology , biological substrates that likely underlie this relationship , and implications for treatment."
27914211,"microRNAs ( miRNAs ) are well - known , powerful regulators of gene expression , and their potential to serve as circulating biomarkers is widely accepted."
27914211,"In cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , numerous studies have suggested miRNAs as strong circulating biomarkers with high diagnostic as well as prognostic power."
27914211,"In coronary artery disease ( CAD ) and heart failure ( HF ) , miRNAs have been suggested as reliable biomarkers matching up to established protein - based such as cardiac troponins ( cT ) or natriuretic peptides."
27914211,"Also , in other CVD entities , miRNAs were identified as surprisingly specific biomarkers - with great potential for clinical applicability , especially in those entities that lack specific protein - based biomarkers such as atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and acute pulmonary embolism ( APE )."
27914211,"In this regard , miRNA signatures , comprising a set of miRNAs , yield high sensitivity and specificity."
27914211,Attempts to utilize miRNAs as therapeutic agents have led to promising results.
27914211,"In this article , we review the clinical applicability of circulating miRNAs in CVD."
27914211,We are giving an overview of miRNAs as biomarkers in numerous CVD entities to depict the variety of their potential clinical deployment.
27914211,We illustrate the function of miRNAs by means of single miRNA examples in CVD.
27886791,Environmental exposures in low - and middle - income countries lie at the intersection of increased economic development and the rising public health burden of cardiovascular disease.
27886791,"Increasing evidence suggests an association of exposure to ambient air pollution , household air pollution from biomass fuel , lead , arsenic , and cadmium with multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes , including hypertension , coronary heart disease , stroke , and cardiovascular mortality."
27886791,"Although populations in low - and middle - income countries are disproportionately exposed to environmental pollution , evidence linking these exposures to cardiovascular disease is derived from populations in high - income countries."
27886791,More research is needed to further characterize the extent of environmental exposures.
31378756,Metabolomics has developed as a powerful tool for investigating the complex pathophysiology underlying atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.
31378756,"Many epidemiological studies have applied this technique to accurately and comprehensively assess the effects of environmental factors on health outcomes , which used to be a perpetual challenge."
31378756,Metabolites are defined as small molecules which are intermediate products of metabolic reactions catalyzed by numerous enzymes occurring within cells.
31378756,"Consequent to both genetic variation and environment , they allow us to explore the gene - environment interactions and to gain a better understanding of multifactorial diseases like cardiovascular disease."
31378756,"This review article highlights the findings of well - known prospective cohort studies around the world that have utilized metabolomics for a wide range of purposes , including biomarker discovery , improving cardiovascular risk prediction and early disease diagnosis , and exploring detailed mechanisms of disease onset and progression."
31378756,"However , technical challenges still exist in applying them clinically."
31378756,One limitation is due to various analytical platforms that are used based on the judgment of each study ; comparative assessments among different platforms need to be conducted in order to correctly interpret and validate each data externally.
31378756,"Secondly , metabolite levels obtained in most high - throughput metabolomics profiling studies are often semiquantitative rather than fully quantitative concentrations , which makes it difficult to compare and combine results among different studies and to determine the levels for practical use."
31378756,"In 2014 , the Consortium of Metabolomics Studies was developed , which is expected to take the lead in overcoming these issues."

18572045,"In conclusion , this review addresses the imminent threats and ways to tackle the epidemic in India."
18287250,Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of graft loss and the leading cause of death in renal transplant recipients.
18287250,"Although there are robust data on the frequency of risk factors and their contributions to cardiovascular disease in this population , few trials have demonstrated the benefit of modifying these risk factors to reduce cardiovascular events."
18287250,"Nevertheless , it is widely accepted that the clinical acumen filtered through the best available studies in the general population be used to treat individual renal transplant recipients given their high cardiovascular mortality."
18287250,Transplant task forces and the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative have created guidelines for this purpose.
18287250,This review examines the data available for prevention and treatment of major risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease in renal transplant recipients.

23621966,"Growing evidence supports a causal relationship between cardiovascular disease and psychosocial factors such as mental health and behavioral disorders , acute and chronic stress , and low socioeconomic status."
23621966,"While this has enriched our understanding of the interaction between cardiovascular risk factors , much less is known about its economic implications."
23621966,"In this review , we evaluate the economic impact of psychosocial factors in persons at risk for or diagnosed with cardiovascular disease."
23621966,Most studies have focused on depression and almost uniformly conclude that patients with cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression use a greater number of ambulatory and hospital services and incur higher overall costs.
23621966,"Additionally , comorbid depression may also reduce employment productivity in patients with cardiovascular disease , further magnifying its economic impact."
23621966,Recent randomized trials have demonstrated that innovative care delivery models that target depression may reduce costs or at least be cost neutral while improving quality of life.
23621966,"The growing population burden and overlap of cardiovascular disease , comorbid mental illness , and other psychosocial factors suggest that future research identifying cost - effective or cost - saving treatment models may have significant health and economic implications."

24768945,"Epigenetic processes , defined as heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes to the DNA sequence , have emerged as a promising area of cardiovascular disease research."
24768945,Epigenetic information transcends that of the genotype alone and provides for an integrated etiologic picture of cardiovascular disease pathogenesis because of the interaction of the epigenome with the environment.
24768945,"Epigenetic biomarkers , which include DNA methylation , histone modifications , and RNA - based mechanisms , are both modifiable and cell - type specific , which makes them not only responsive to the environment , but also an attractive target for drug development."
24768945,"However , the enthusiasm surrounding possible applications of cardiovascular epigenetics currently outpaces available evidence."
24768945,"In this review , the authors synthesize the evidence linking epigenetic changes with cardiovascular disease , emphasizing the gap between the translational potential and the clinical reality of cardiovascular epigenetics."

18090678,Purpose of review : Patients with end - stage renal disease have an extremely high cardiovascular disease mortality.
18090678,Oxidative stress is one of the ' nontraditional ' risk factors for cardiovascular disease mortality in dialysis patients.
18090678,This review discusses antioxidant activity of the commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents and the effects of antioxidant interventions on cardiovascular disease mortality in patients with end - stage renal disease.
18090678,"Recent findings : Several lines of evidence confirm antioxidant activity of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone antagonists , some of the calcium channel blockers , carvedilol , and hydralazine."
18090678,This appears to be independent of their antihypertensive activity.
18090678,"Clinical evidence of their superiority in improving cardiovascular disease endpoints in end - stage renal disease , however , is lacking."
18090678,There are no randomized trials that have examined the effect of correcting oxidative stress on clinical endpoints.
18090678,One randomized study in patients on hemodialysis reported a reduction in oxidative stress and the plasma methylarginines with valsartan and amlodipine but no clinical endpoints were examined.
18090678,Summary : The effects of the antihypertensive agents with antioxidant activity on cardiovascular disease mortality in end - stage renal disease have not been examined in randomized clinical trials.
18090678,"These agents may offer specific clinical advantage in addition to lowering the blood pressure , but this remains to be proven."
18090678,Two studies show a reduction in cardiovascular disease events with vitamin E and N - acetylcysteine in patients on hemodialysis without an effect on overall mortality.
14736430,Humans are prone to sodium overload and potassium depletion.

14736430,The evidence highlighting the importance of potassium homeostasis in cardiovascular disease and possible mechanisms explaining potassium 's benefits are reviewed.
14736430,Targets for serum potassium concentration are suggested.
17113010,"Introduction : Cardiovascular disease , the leading cause of death in much of the modern world , is the common symptomatic end stage of a number of distinct diseases and , therefore , is multifactorial and polygenetic in character."
17113010,The two major underlying causes are disorders of lipid metabolism and metabolic syndrome.
17113010,The ability to develop preventative and ameliorative treatments will depend on animal models that mimic human disease processes.
17113010,The focus of this review is to identify suitable animal models and insights into cardiovascular disease achieved to date using such models.
17113010,"Criteria for animal models : The ideal animal model of cardiovascular disease will mimic the human subject metabolically and pathophysiologically , will be large enough to permit physiological and metabolic studies , and will develop end - stage disease comparable to those in humans."
17113010,"Given the complex multifactorial nature of cardiovascular disease , no one species will be suitable for all studies."
17113010,"Available models : Potential larger animal models are problematic due to cost , ethical considerations , or poor pathophysiological comparability to humans."
17113010,"Rabbits require high - cholesterol diets to develop cardiovascular disease , and there are no rabbit models of metabolic syndrome."
17113010,"Spontaneous mutations in rats provide several complementary models of obesity , hyperlipidemia , insulin resistance , and type 2 diabetes , one of which spontaneously develops cardiovascular disease and ischemic lesions."
17113010,"The mouse , like normal rats , is characteristically resistant to cardiovascular disease , although genetically altered strains respond to cholesterol feeding with atherosclerosis , but not with end - stage ischemic lesions."
17113010,"Conclusions : The most useful and valid species / strains for the study of cardiovascular disease appear to be small rodents , rats , and mice."
17113010,This fragmented field would benefit from a consensus on well - characterized appropriate models for the study of different aspects of cardiovascular disease and a renewed emphasis on the biology of underlying diseases.
15490402,"The risk for cardiovascular disease is significantly higher among patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) than among the general population , considering that cardiovascular disease is the prominent cause of both morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients."
15490402,"This is explained mainly by the considerable prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among CKD patients since the earliest stages of renal impairment , which include not only the so - called traditional risk factors , but also a number of additional risk factors that are specific to CKD and to the dialytic treatment itself."
15490402,"Considering the multiplicity of cardiovascular risk factors operating in CKD patients , as well as the crucial impact of their cardiovascular condition on long - term outcome , it is mandatory that all the available interventions aimed at the correction of all the modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease are performed as early as possible in the progression of the disease."
15490402,"In particular , the results of several controlled clinical trials have shown that a timely correction of anemia and of calcium - phosphate disorders leads to a significant improvement in the cardiovascular conditions of CKD patients."
15490402,Evidence also is growing regarding the benefits of intervention of newly recognized risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as inflammation and oxidant stress.
23141876,"The term "" Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease "" ( NAFLD ) covers a series of liver lesions similar to those induced by alcohol , but not caused by alcohol use."
23141876,"The importance of NAFLD lies in the high prevalence in Western societies and , from the point of view of the liver , in its progression from steatosis to cirrhosis and liver cancer."
23141876,"More recently , NAFLD has been found to be associated with lipid metabolism disorders , the deposition of fat outside of the adipocytes , insulin resistance and Metabolic Syndrome."
23141876,"Also attributed to NAFLD is a heightened systemic pro-inflammatory state , which accelerates arteriosclerosis , thereby increasing cardiovascular risk and associated cardiovascular events."
23141876,"Here we provide an update to the etiopathogenesis of NAFLD , its influence on cardiovascular disease , and the treatment options."
21929342,Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in women despite advances in treatment strategies.
21929342,Challenges currently exist when making the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
21929342,Equitable treatment of women once the disease has been identified is a further conundrum.
21929342,Observational data have helped to identify those women at a higher risk of mortality and morbidity attributable to coronary artery disease.
21929342,Interpretation of individual risk factors differs between the genders.
21929342,"Treatment may also differ depending on appropriate proper risk stratification , using newer models that take into account gender differences."
21929342,Outcomes can be improved with the proper use of existing risk stratification tools.
23745805,"Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by low insulin production / secretion by pancreatic beta cells and / or low responsiveness by insulin target tissues MicroRNAs have been associated with DM , but it is not clear whether this is a cause or an effect of metabolic abnormalities related to DM."
23745805,In the hyperglycemic environment miRNAs are in involved in multiple stages of cardiovascular disease development and progression.
23745805,In diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease miRNAs could potentially serve as early biomarkers for diagnosis and as therapeutic agents.
23745805,The current review focuses on the involvement of miRNAs in molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of DM and its cardiovascular complications.
11256587,"The renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system ( RAS ) plays a pivotal role in the cardiovascular system , and the therapeutic agents which interact with this pathway have a significant impact in both heart failure and following myocardial infarction ( MI )."
11256587,Polymorphisms within the genes controlling this enzyme system may also contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.
11256587,"Over the last decade an association between a polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) gene ( called the DD - ACE polymorphism ) and phenotypic expression of cardiovascular disease , namely MI , has been reported."
11256587,"Since then , several small case - controlled studies have confirmed an association with manifestations of ischaemic heart disease or various other cardiac end points."
11256587,"However , in a large prospective study the ACE gene was found to confer no appreciable risk."
11256587,This review article considers the evidence that links polymorphisms of the ACE gene with cardiovascular disease.
11256587,"The Medline database ( 1990 - 2000 ) was searched using the keywords myocardial infarction , ischaemic heart disease , angiotensin converting enzyme , polymorphisms ( a search of the reference citations of relevant articles was also performed ) , and clinical studies on cardiovascular disease related to the ACE genotype were selected."
11256587,"Taken together , the available evidence supports the notion that the DD - ACE genotype adversely influences specific cardiovascular diseases , but appears to do so in specific geographical areas and in particular patient subgroups."
11256587,It is not yet known whether it does this through an interaction with other genes or by as yet unexplained biochemical mechanisms.
11256587,"However , the impact of the DD - ACE genotype appears to be small and its clinical manifestations rather heterogeneous."
11256587,"This finding is not in contrast to the overall impact of the renin - angiotensin system in cardiovascular disease , given the fact that the ACE enzyme is only one component in the renin - angiotensin cascade and that one genetic variant can not be expected to contribute more than a minor individual impact in genetically complex multifactorial cardiovascular disease."
23911986,Cardiovascular disease remains the commonest form of mortality and morbidity in the Western World.
23911986,It accounts for more deaths than the combined incidence of all cancers.
23911986,There remains an urgency to identify and translate therapies to reduce the effects of this disease and its associated co-morbidities.
23911986,Atherosclerotic disease accounts for over two thirds of all cardiovascular related deaths.
23911986,Arterial vessel wall plaques rupture and cause death due to loss of integrity of the overlaying vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) cap.
23911986,"Although plaques contain a heterogeneous pool of different cell types , it is the VSMCs that by their nature are responsible for rupture."
23911986,VSMC are the primary source of extracellular matrix and collagen and it has been suggested that loss of viability and vitality of these cells contributes to plaque vulnerability and rupture.
23911986,While DNA damage has long been associated with atherosclerotic plaques only relatively recently has the contribution of mitochondrial DNA damage been suggested to play a role.
23911986,The mitochondrial respiratory chain is a source of ATP that the cell requires for all its energetic functions but is also a source of free radicals that produce reactive species ( RS ).
23911986,"While these RS exacerbate DNA damage and attack lipids and proteins , it is the loss of ATP that may ultimately be more detrimental."
23911986,Therapeutic intervention for mitochondria dysfunction is one route on alleviating this burden.
23911986,Finding alternative sources of ATP synthesis by energetic reconfiguration may also provide a vital link in delaying the kinetics of plaque rupture.
19124415,"Contrary to the age old taboo of exercise in cardiac patients , resistance training has been gaining importance recently as a safe , healthy fitness option in prevention of cardiovascular diseases , the leading killer disease in the population above 45 years in the United States."
19124415,Endurance or aerobic exercise helps improve overall stamina and the ability of the heart to pump oxygenated blood in those with and without prior cardiovascular disease.
19124415,"In addition to modifying cardiovascular risks , resistance training has profound beneficial effects on improving muscle strength and endurance , preventing osteoporosis and improving quality of life both in the healthy and cardiovascular patients including women and heart failure patients."
19124415,So resistance training should be regarded as a complementary fitness program rather that a substitute to endurance training.
19124415,This review discusses the physiological phenomenon and benefits of exercise training programs on cardiovascular disease patients focusing on endurance exercise and resistance training.
23478256,"Cellular senescence , defined as arrest during the cell cycle ( G ₀ ) , is involved in the complex process of the biological ageing of tissues , organs , and organisms."
23478256,"Senescence is driven by many factors including oxidative stress , the DNA damage and repair response , inflammation , mitogenic signals , and telomere shortening."
23478256,Telomeres are shortened by each cell division until a critical length is reached and dysfunction ensues.
23478256,"DNA - repair pathways are then recruited and cells enter senescence , losing their capacity to proliferate."
23478256,"In addition to cell division , factors causing telomere shortening include DNA damage , inflammation , and oxidative stress."
23478256,"Both cardiovascular risk factors and common cardiovascular diseases , such as atherosclerosis , heart failure , and hypertension , are associated with short leucocyte telomeres , but causality remains undetermined."
23478256,"Telomere length does not satisfy strict criteria for being a biomarker of ageing , but adds predictive power to that of chronological age , and can be considered a marker of cardiovascular ageing."
23478256,"The ' senescence - associated secretory phenotype ' of senescent cells exerts a wide range of autocrine and paracrine activities aimed at tissue repair , but which also fuel degenerative and proliferative alterations that contribute to cardiovascular disease."
23478256,"In this Review , the relationship between telomere shortening , senescence , and cardiovascular disease is discussed."
15340730,"As a result of an aging , increasingly obese , and decreasingly physically active population , the global incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is increasing."
15340730,"While little can be done to influence the contribution of aging to the increasing global prevalence of diabetes , opportunities abound to develop effective interventions with regard to diet , exercise and obesity to prevent type 2 DM and more importantly , diabetes - associated complications."
15340730,"The major cause of morbidity and mortality from diabetes is from atherosclerotic macrovascular disease - including peripheral , cerebrovascular , and coronary artery disease."
15340730,The markedly increased risk for cardiovascular disease associated with diabetes compound medical and public health challenges in the face of the burgeoning global epidemic of diabetes and will inevitably strain healthcare resources.
15340730,"Although the cardiovascular benefits of glycemic control have yet to be clearly established , a number of therapeutic interventions improve cardiovascular risk among the high - risk cohort of patients with diabetes."
15340730,The development of new strategies targeting both primary prevention of diabetes and the prevention of diabetic complications will remain important research and clinical objectives.
15340730,"Great advances are being made in the realm of diabetes and cardiovascular disease , and there is much optimism for the future."
24801729,Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) represents a major health risk to the global population.
24801729,"In disease settings , cells that constitute the vasculature undergo profound changes both morphologically and functionally paralleling alterations in gene expression profile."
24801729,"At the transcriptional level , gene expression is steered by the epigenetic machinery including DNA methyltransferases , histone variants , non-coding regulatory RNAs , chromatin remodeling complexes , and histone modifying enzymes."
24801729,"The N - terminal tails of histones , primarily histones H3 and H4 , are post-translationally modified creating a unique platform for transcriptional regulation."
24801729,This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of histone methylation in modulating the vascular transcriptome and its relevance in CVD with an outlook on future directions.
19131033,"Cardiovascular disease in small exotic mammals is anecdotally common , but clinical reports of diagnosis and treatment of disease are rare."

32139199,Background : Information on the world distribution of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in refugees / migrants is not available at the same rate for all countries or for different ethnic and socioeconomic groups.
32139199,"Today , Syria 's humanitarian catastrophe has become a public health concern , which can not be ignored."
32139199,Methods : A search was conducted across PubMed and Google Scholar for papers on cardiovascular diseases among refugees / migrants worldwide with a focus on Syrian in Turkey.
32139199,Results : The total number of papers identified through the database searches and from reference lists was 486.
32139199,"Of these , 62 were found to be relevant after further screening."
32139199,"A further 42 papers were considered not eligible after full - text , language and data assessments , resulting in a final 20 papers included in the qualitative analysis."
32139199,"These studies discussed several major themes : cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors among refugees / migrants , the effects of changing living conditions on refugees / migrants , the effects of psychological and socioeconomic factors , and the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in refugees / migrants."
32139199,"The risk of cardiovascular disease varied by country of origin , country of destination , and duration of residence."
32139199,The findings suggest that cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors are increased for Syrian refugees in Turkey.
32139199,"Conclusion : Raising awareness , prevention , early detection , and good management as well as monitoring and reporting of risk factors are the key components to controlling cardiovascular diseases in refugees."
32139199,Further studies and greater acquisition of survey data are urgently needed.
24268601,It has been widely thought that the effects of hypertension in pregnancy reversed after delivery and hypertension values returned to their pre-pregnancy level as it was seen as a disease of short duration in otherwise healthy young women.
24268601,"However , recent studies have demonstrated that the principal underlying abnormality , endothelial dysfunction , remains in women who had preeclampsia and that it is this damage that increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) in later life."
24268601,The contributions of hypertension and dyslipidaemia before and during the pregnancy are also important and contribute to future risk.
24268601,Serum lipids are complex and change dramatically in pregnancy.
24268601,"In general there is an increase in most plasma lipid components , notably triglycerides , total cholesterol and the major particles of HDL and LDL."
24268601,Aberrations or exaggerations in this shift ( i.e. decrease HDL and a greater increase in LDL ) are associated with poor outcomes of pregnancy such as preeclampsia.
24268601,Long term cardiovascular disease is influenced by preeclampsia and in part potentially by the lipid changes which escalate late in disease.
24268601,"Whether we can influence the risk of preeclampsia by controlling cardiovascular risk factors preceding or during preeclampsia , or cardiovascular disease after preeclampsia is yet to be determined."
24268601,"Ultimately , strategies to control lipid concentrations will only be viable when we understand the safety to the mother at the time of the pregnancy , and to the foetus both immediately and in the very long term."
24268601,"Strategies to control blood pressure are well established in the non-pregnant population , and previous preeclampsia and gestational hypertension should be considered in any cardiovascular risk profile."
24268601,Whether control of blood pressure in the pregnancy per se is of any longer term benefit is also yet to be determined.
18855714,"C - reactive protein ( CRP ) is an acute - phase protein , which has been used in clinical practice as a non specific marker of inflammation."
18855714,Many studies have shown that CRP is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
18855714,It is currently unknown if CRP plays an active role as an etiologic factor in cardiovascular disease.
18855714,The mechanisms by which CRP may contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease are poorly understood.
18855714,"The effect of CRP on atherogenesis may include interactions with other factors of immunity and inflammation , such as the complement system , as well as a direct effect of CRP on the cells involved in atherosclerotic lesions."
18855714,We review the literature concerning the mechanisms by which CRP may influence the development of cardiovascular disease and discuss the findings of clinical studies assessing the association between CRP and cardiovascular disease.
19811232,"World - wide , cardiovascular disease is mainly seen as a male problem , whereas breast cancer is considered to be the most important chronic disease in women."
19811232,"However , cardiovascular disease is the largest single cause of death also in women , accounting for approximately one - third of the mortality , while breast cancer is responsible for less than 5 % of the mortality."
19811232,Physicians and women are equally unaware of these numbers.
19811232,"From a public health viewpoint , morbidity might be even more important , given the fact that therapeutic strategies have improved in the last decades , and disease fatality has been decreasing."

21689660,The urocortins are a group of recently defined peptide members of the corticotrophin - releasing factor family.
21689660,Previous pre-clinical work and human association studies suggest that urocortins have potential to exert some beneficial and other detrimental effects on the heart and major blood vessels.
21689660,"More current evidence however favours beneficial effects of urocortins , for example these peptides have been shown to inhibit production of reactive oxygen species and vascular cell apoptosis , and thus may have potential to antagonise the progression of cardiovascular disease."
21689660,This review summarises published data on the potential role of urocortins in cardiovascular disease.

14978153,This review focuses on the association between mild renal insufficiency ( stage 2 and 3 of chronic kidney disease ) and cardiovascular disease and discusses therapeutic options.
14978153,"Although the association of chronic renal insufficiency and cardiovascular risk was first shown in patients with end - stage renal disease , even minor renal dysfunction is now established as an independent risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease."
14978153,The association has been established in patients with a high cardiovascular risk but also in the general population.
14978153,Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors and statins can reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with renal insufficiency.
14978153,"Coronary revascularization improves the prognosis in patients with minor renal dysfunction , but there is still an underutilization of coronary revascularization procedures in people with renal insufficiency."

22954325,Background : Data from large epidemiological studies suggest that elevated heart rate is independently associated with cardiovascular and all - cause mortality in patients with hypertension and in those with established cardiovascular disease.
22954325,"Clinical trial findings also suggest that the favorable effects of beta - blockers and other heart rate - lowering agents in patients with acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure may be , at least in part , due to their heart rate - lowering effects."
22954325,Contemporary clinical outcome prediction models such as the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events ( GRACE ) score include admission heart rate as an independent risk factor.
22954325,"Aims : This article critically reviews the key epidemiology concerning heart rate and cardiovascular risk , potential mechanisms through which an elevated resting heart rate may be disadvantageous and evaluates clinical trial outcomes associated with pharmacological reduction in resting heart rate."
22954325,Conclusions : Prospective randomised data from patients with significant coronary heart disease or heart failure suggest that intervention to reduce heart rate in those with a resting heart rate > 70 bpm may reduce cardiovascular risk.
22954325,"Given the established observational data and randomised trial evidence , it now appears appropriate to include reduction of elevated resting heart rate by lifestyle + / - pharmacological therapy as part of a secondary prevention strategy in patients with cardiovascular disease."
11140908,Multiple mechanisms are likely for any effect of fiber on cardiovascular disease risk.

23537487,"Multiple studies have demonstrated that depression is more prevalent in populations with cardiovascular disease , is a robust risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease in healthy populations , and is predictive of adverse outcomes ( such as myocardial infarction and death ) among populations with preexisting cardiovascular disease."
23537487,"Mechanistic studies have shown that poor health behaviors , such as physical inactivity , medication nonadherence , and smoking , strongly contribute to this association."
23537487,Small randomized trials have found that antidepressant therapies may improve cardiac outcomes.
23537487,"Based on this accumulating evidence , the American Heart Association has recommended routine screening for depression in all patients with coronary heart disease."
23537487,This review examines the key epidemiological literature on depression and cardiovascular disorders and discusses our current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this association.

12243615,Data sources : Pertinent literature was identified through a MEDLINE search ( 1966 - September 2001 ) and through other secondary literature databases and / or bibliographies of pertinent articles.
12243615,"Data synthesis : Cardiovascular disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among the general population , with well - defined risk factors ( e.g. , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , cigarette smoking , genetic predisposition )."
12243615,"Clinical data evaluating the association between the aforementioned risk factors and the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease are substantial ; however , these risk factors may only partially explain the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease."
12243615,The presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae within atherosclerotic lesions has been documented and may be an additional risk factor for the development and progression of cardiovascular disease.
12243615,Conclusions : The results of primary and secondary prevention trials have shown conflicting evidence with regard to the beneficial effects of antibiotic therapy to reduce cardiovascular events.
12243615,"Currently , the lack of certainty in published data does not support the use of antibiotics for the prevention of cardiovascular disease."

32090295,Autophagy is a lysosomal - mediated intracellular degradation mechanism for excessive or abnormal proteins and lipids.
32090295,The contribution of autophagy to normal and disease - state cell physiology is extremely complicated.
32090295,Autophagy acts as a double - edged sword in the cardiovascular system.
32090295,It can defend against damage to cells caused by environmental changes and it can also induce active cell death under certain conditions.
32090295,"In recent years , accumulating evidence indicates that H2S can up - or downregulate autophagy in many pathological processes , thereby switching from a harmful to a beneficial role."

27534982,S4 was detected in nine ( 4.5 per cent ; significantly older than those without S4 ; P < 0.001 ).
27534982,A heart murmur was detected in four donkeys.
27534982,"Echocardiography identified these to be due to a ventricular septal defect in one , and aortic regurgitation in three."
27534982,An additional 43 donkeys had echocardiography.
27534982,"A further 10 donkeys were identified to have aortic insufficiency , but no other valvular regurgitation."
27534982,76/202 donkeys subsequently underwent postmortem examination.
27534982,Three showed degenerative aortic valve changes.
27534982,One donkey had nodular lesions in the intima of proximal aorta and sinus of Valsalva.

23806547,Heart rate is a predictor of cardiovascular and all - cause mortality in the general population and in patients with cardiovascular disease.
23806547,Increased resting heart rate multiplies risk and interferes at all stages of the cardiovascular disease continuum initiating from endothelial dysfunction and continuing via atherosclerotic lesion formation and plaque rupture to end - stage cardiovascular disease.
23806547,"As a therapeutic target , heart rate is accessible via numerous pharmacological interventions."
23806547,The concept of selective heart rate reduction by the I ( f ) current inhibitor ivabradine provides an option to intervene effectively along the chain of events and to define the specific and prognostic role of heart rate for patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure.
23806547,Future interventional studies will further clarify the significance of heart rate and targeted heart rate reduction for primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.

10093765,"In the past 10 years , the development of new technology to measure subclinical disease has provided the opportunity to evaluate the prevalence of subclinical disease , the risk factors for subclinical disease , and the risk for clinical disease given the presence or absence of subclinical disease."
10423080,Cardiovascular disease is responsible for a large and increasing proportion of death and disability worldwide.
10423080,Half of this burden occurs in Asia.
10423080,"This study assessed the possible effects of population - wide ( 2 % lower DBP for all ) and targeted ( 7 % lower DBP for those with usual DBP > or = 95 mmHg ) BP interventions in Asia , using data from surveys of blood pressure levels , the Global Burden of Disease Project , Eastern Asian cohort studies and randomised trials of blood pressure lowering."
10423080,Overall each of the two interventions would be expected to avert about one million deaths per year throughout Asia in 2020.
10423080,These benefits would be approximately additive.
10423080,"About half a million deaths might be averted annually by each intervention in China alone , with about four - fifths of this benefit due to averted stroke."
10423080,The relative benefits of these two strategies are similar to estimates made for US and UK populations.
10423080,"However , the absolute benefits are many times greater due to the size of the predicted CVD burden in Asia."
9457149,Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women.
9457149,Approaches to diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease in women often differ from those in men.
9457149,"In some instances , these differences are justified by clinical trial and epidemiologic data."
9457449,The factors which have led to a dramatic increase in the numbers of the elderly and the impact of this ageing population on health care resources is discussed.
9457449,"The importance of looking at the total disease burden of a particular disorder rather than just its mortality rate is emphasized , particularly in regard to cardiovascular disease."
18607395,A debate has emerged as to what should be the ' appropriate ' cardiovascular agenda for sub-Saharan Africa.
18607395,"This Clinical Advance article reviews a recent study by Sliwa et al. , which describes patients with newly diagnosed cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) presenting to a tertiary - care center in South Africa."
18607395,"The most common conditions among these patients were hypertension , heart failure , valvular heart disease , and coronary artery disease."
18607395,Atherosclerotic risk factors were widely prevalent -- only 13 % of patients had no risk factors at all.
18607395,"Furthermore , a substantial proportion of patients presented at an advanced stage of disease."
18607395,"This study , which used state - of - the - art diagnostic technology , is an important addition to the growing database of information indicating that CVD in sub-Saharan Africa spans the spectrum from ' traditional ' , nonischemic etiologies to ' modern ' diseases of lifestyle."
18607395,The societal response to this diverse epidemiology should be similarly multifaceted.
18607395,"Moreover , efforts should be made to improve primary - care screening , early detection and treatment of CVD , and prompt referral of patients at early stages of disease."
30051377,"In spite of a remarkable decline in death rates from cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) observed over the last decades , CVD still remains the leading cause of mortality in both men and women worldwide."
30051377,Overall the age - adjusted CVD mortality and morbidity rates are highest in men than in women.
30051377,"However , the risk of CVD in women should not be underestimated given that approximately one of two women in developed countries will die of mostly preventable heart diseases or stroke."
30051377,"Although men and women share the same cardiovascular risk factors , there are substantial sex differences in the first manifestation and clinical presentation of CVD."
30051377,"In this part of the chapter , we will discuss the recent epidemiological data on sex discrepancies in the prevalence and burden of different CVDs."
7736485,"It has recently been shown that approximately 90 % of cases of non-fatal myocardial infarction and many cases of sudden cardiac death are caused by disruption of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque , followed by occlusive thrombus formation."
7736485,"Secondly , the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction is well known to feature a prominent increase in the morning hours."
7736485,"Taken together , these factors may provide an opportunity to reduce deaths caused by cardiovascular disease."
7736485,"Findings indicate that , in many cases , plaque disruption and thrombus formation are triggered by the activities of the patient."
7736485,It is postulated that onset occurs when a ' vulnerable ' atherosclerotic plaque becomes disrupted and occlusive thrombus formation occurs.
7736485,The occurrence of a myocardial infarction in the morning hours could result from the synchronization of a number of potential triggers.
7736485,The importance of the recognition of the circadian variation of acute onset of myocardial infarction is that pharmacologic protection can be directed at the early waking hours.
7736485,It would seem reasonable to propose that long - acting anti-ischemic agents would have an advantage over short - acting agents in providing protection against the morning occurrence of myocardial infarction.
7736485,A future goal would be to design therapeutic regimens that would have the ability to sever the linkage between a potential triggering activity and the development of myocardial infarction.
18785947,"Objective : To review data examining the relationships between depression , antidepressants and cardiovascular disease."
18785947,"Method : Structured searches of PubMed , Medline and Embase conducted in March 2008."
18785947,Results : Depression and cardiovascular disease are closely associated clinical entities.
18785947,Depression appears both to cause and worsen cardiovascular disease.
18785947,Cardiovascular disease is in turn associated with a high incidence of depression.
18785947,"Depression is associated with increased mortality in cardiovascular disease , and after myocardial infarction ( MI ) and stroke."
18785947,Many antidepressants have cardiotoxic properties.
18785947,Tricyclic drugs are highly cardiotoxic in overdose and may induce cardiovascular disease and worsen outcome in established cardiovascular disease.
18785947,"Reboxetine , duloxetine and venlafaxine are known to increase blood pressure."
18785947,Other antidepressants have neutral or beneficial effects in various cardiovascular disorders.
18785947,"Conclusion : Sertraline , fluoxetine , citalopram , bupropion and mirtazapine appear to be safe to use after MI ; the use of sertraline , and response to citalopram and mirtazapine may improve mortality."
18785947,Paroxetine and citalopram appear to be safe to use in patients with established coronary artery disease.
18785947,Limited data suggest that a variety of antidepressants are effective and safe to use after stroke.
32715520,Clonal haematopoiesis results from acquired mutations in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ).
32715520,"These mutations can confer the HSPC with a competitive advantage , leading to their clonal expansion within the limiting bone marrow niche."
32715520,"This process is often insufficient to produce a haematologic malignancy ; however , the expanding HSPC clones increasingly give rise to progeny leucocytes whose phenotypes can be altered by the somatic mutations that they harbour."
32715520,Key findings from multiple human studies have shown that clonal haematopoiesis in the absence of overt haematologic alterations is common amongst the ageing population and associated with mortality and cardiovascular disease.
32715520,"Key findings from experimental studies have provided evidence for a causative role for clonal haematopoiesis in cardiovascular diseases , and aspects of these mechanisms have been elucidated."
32715520,"Whilst our understanding of the impact and biology of clonal haematopoiesis is in its infancy , analyses of some of the most commonly mutated driver genes suggest promising clinical scenarios involving the development of personalized therapies with immunomodulatory drugs that exploit the perturbation caused by the particular mutation."
32715520,"Herein , we review the accumulating epidemiological and experimental evidence , and summarize our current understanding of the importance of clonal haematopoiesis as a new causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure."
9860367,"Cardiovascular disease remains the number one killer in the United States , despite advances made in diagnosis and therapy."
9860367,A major shift to expand treatment beyond symptomatic obstructions and infarctions toward comprehensive therapies aimed at treatment of the underlying disease process could decrease the death rate and cost of cardiovascular disease enormously.
9860367,"In the past 5 years , major trials have clearly demonstrated that aggressive intervention with lipid - lowering therapy can dramatically alter the course of disease."
9860367,"Aspirin , smoking cessation , exercise , diet , and other medical and lifestyle interventions can also decrease risk."
9860367,"Successful therapies are not being implemented , however."
9860367,"Making prevention the primary approach to treatment will require increased resource allocation , use of health provider teams , integration of healthcare delivery systems , and expanded emphasis on educating patients about prevention."
30720844,The effectiveness of treatment and prevention of chronic illnesses can be optimised with adherence to medication treatment.
30720844,This is very often assessed by means of a self - report.
30720844,"However , the challenge here is to choose the most suitable questionnaire or the one that is best overall in a given situation."
30720844,"The aim of this systematic review was to assess existing self - reported medication adherence scales , which measure adherence to treatment for cardiovascular disease."
30720844,The review demonstrated that relatively few disease - specific adherence scales exist.
30720844,Generic questionnaires and those specific to adherence to hypertension treatment are the most numerous.
30720844,Questionnaires specifically measuring adherence to anti-haemorrhage treatment for atrial fibrillation are particularly necessary and noticeably absent.
30720844,The two most important aspects that need to be taken into account when selecting the most appropriate scale in a given context are the subject of the measurement ( what ) and the method of validation ( how ).
29470788,New guidelines on hypertension eliminated the classification of prehypertension and divided those blood pressure ( BP ) levels into elevated BP and stage 1 hypertension.
29470788,"For elevated BP , this study showed that cardiovascular ( CV ) abnormalities were prevalent in adults over 40 years of age with at least 2 CV risk factors."
29470788,Detecting abnormalities of the CV system moves a patient from being at high risk to having earlystage cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and supports a decision to treat.
29470788,"By redefining stage 1 and lowering the target BP , the new guidelines have set an ambitious goal for early intervention to prevent progression of CVD."
29470788,Proper drug selection and titration are critical.
29470788,Hypertensive patients have diverse CV abnormalities that can be quantified by impedance cardiography.
29470788,"By stratifying patients with ventricular , vascular , and hemodynamic abnormalities , treatment can be customized based on the abnormal underlying mechanisms to rapidly control BP and prevent progression of CVD."
16222630,"As a consequence of seminal laboratory and experimental work conducted in the 1970s , infections have recently been recognized among possible risk factors for atherosclerosis and its clinical cardiovascular disease manifestations."
16222630,The infectious hypothesis also relates to modern atherogenesis theories that consider the crucial role of inflammation in the initial development as well as in the natural history of the atherosclerotic plaque.
16222630,"During the last 2 decades , numerous clinical and epidemiologic studies have explored the association between markers of chronic infections in relation to a variety of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease outcomes."
16222630,"These studies have focused on a variety of agents including herpesvirus ( especially cytomegalovirus ) , Chlamydia pneumonia , Helicobacter pylori , and periodontal pathogens , and have produced inconsistent results."
16222630,Some of the limitations and methodological issues in interpreting the existing epidemiologic evidence are discussed in this article.
16222630,"In addition , other supporting evidence is presented here , including pathology studies documenting the presence of infectious agents ' DNA in atherosclerotic plaque tissue and experimental infection models in animal studies."
16222630,Areas for future research are discussed in light of the strengths and limitations of the existing evidence.
19811237,"Premature menopause and bilateral oophorectomy in young women are associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease , myocardial infarction and overall mortality."
19811237,Observational studies suggest an interval of 5 - 10 years between loss of ovarian function and the increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
19811237,This finding is consonant with a published autopsy study of women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy.
19811237,The progression of atherosclerosis is retarded with the use of estrogen replacement therapy in non-human primates and women.
19811237,Hormone therapy reduced the incidence of cardiovascular disease in women following bilateral oophorectomy.
19811237,These findings support the use of hormone therapy in young women who have lost ovarian function.
9637954,"Myths about cardiovascular disease -- that the problem is going away , that it is a "" good "" way to die , and that no further research is needed -- are undermining prevention efforts and funding for research."
9637954,Physicians need to counteract these myths.
10990367,"Hypertension typically worsens with declining renal function , and is an almost universal feature of end - stage renal disease."
10990367,"Treating hypertension clearly reduces the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in nonrenal populations , with greater absolute benefit in those who have greater severity of underlying cardiovascular disease."
10990367,Patients with chronic renal diseases are at enormous cardiovascular risk.
10990367,"Although our approach to hypertension in patients with early renal insufficiency has become more aggressive , the rationale has switched over the past decade from cardiovascular risk reduction to slowing the loss of renal function."
10990367,"Reliance on observational studies , especially using mortality as the outcome , has not allowed a consistent , rational approach to the treatment of hypertension in dialysis patients."
25172068,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world , affecting not only industrialized but , above all , low - and middle - income countries , where it has overtaken infectious diseases as the first cause of death and its impact threatens social and economic development."
25172068,"The increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease in recent years together with projected mortality for the coming decades constitute an irrefutable argument for the urgent implementation of well - planned interventions to control the pandemic of cardiovascular diseases , especially in the more economically deprived countries."
25172068,"The combination of behavioral , social , environmental , and biological factors , and others related to health care systems , that contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases requires a multi-sector strategy that promotes a healthy lifestyle , reduces cardiovascular risk factors , and cuts mortality and morbidity through quality health care services."
25172068,"These proposals should be guided by leaders in the scientific community , government , civil society , private sector , and local communities."
12091628,"A. Post-transplant cardiovascular disease is very common , an important cause of morbidity and the first cause of mortality in renal transplant recipients."
12091628,"Therefore , detection and early treatment of post-transplant cardiovascular disease are mandatory."
12091628,"B. Specific risk factors for developing post-transplant cardiovascular disease include pre-transplant cardiovascular disease , arterial hypertension , uraemia ( graft dysfunction ) , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking and immunosuppressive treatment."
12091628,These factors should be targeted for intervention.
12091628,C. Pre-transplant cardiovascular disease is a major risk factor for post-transplant cardiovascular disease.
12091628,"Therefore , prior to transplantation , it is mandatory to detect and treat symptomatic coronary artery disease , heart failure due to valvular failure or cardiomyopathy , and pericardial constriction."
12091628,This policy should also be followed in asymptomatic diabetic patients.
16411872,"To provide physical activity recommendations for people with cardiovascular disease , an Expert Working Group of the National Heart Foundation of Australia in late 2004 reviewed the evidence since the US Surgeon General 's Report : physical activity and health in 1996."
16411872,"The Expert Working Group recommends that : people with established clinically stable cardiovascular disease should aim , over time , to achieve 30 minutes or more of moderate intensity physical activity on most , if not all , days of the week ; less intense and even shorter bouts of activity with more rest periods may suffice for those with advanced cardiovascular disease ; and regular low - to - moderate level resistance activity , initially under the supervision of an exercise professional , is encouraged."
16411872,"Benefits from regular moderate physical activity for people with cardiovascular disease include augmented physiological functioning , lessening of cardiovascular symptoms , enhanced quality of life , improved coronary risk profile , superior muscle fitness and , for survivors of acute myocardial infarction , lower mortality."
16411872,"The greatest potential for benefit is in those people who were least active before beginning regular physical activity , and this benefit may be achieved even at relatively low levels of physical activity."
16411872,"Medical practitioners should routinely provide brief , appropriate advice on physical activity to people with well - compensated , clinically stable cardiovascular disease."
9095456,Studies promoting wellness and prevention of cardiovascular disease have primarily dealt with identifying risk factors rather than factors that influence the age at which the cardiovascular disease develops.
9095456,The purpose of this study was to determine whether selected risk factors affect the age when cardiovascular disease develops.
9095456,"Using a nonexperimental design , all 800 subjects who developed cardiovascular disease were selected from the Framingham Heart Study."
9095456,A structural equation model for age of cardiovascular disease development was tested.
9095456,"Gender , smoking , entry age , antihypertensive medication use , hemoglobin , body mass index , systolic blood pressure , and diastolic blood pressure were significant determinants of the age at which cardiovascular disease develops."
9095456,The model accounted for 72 % of the variance in age of cardiovascular disease development.
9095456,"The results of this study suggest that in assisting individuals to modify cardiovascular disease risk , cardiovascular nurses and other professionals must address smoking , body mass index , and blood pressure as a package to delay onset of cardiovascular disease symptoms."
18601595,"The practice of cardiology is in continual evolution , in parallel with the progress achieved by medical research in understanding the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and in developing new therapeutic procedures."
18601595,"Consequently , manufacturers of cardiac biomarkers are pressed with new demands to improve the performance of the existing and the development of novel ones."
18601595,Several highly sensitive and / or specific assays for myocardial ischemic damage and myocardial function detection have already become commercially available.
18601595,"Moreover , an increasing number of novel risk factors have been added to the classical risk factors of cardiovascular disease."
18601595,"Finally , the recent surge of genetic analysis procedures will likely soon provide the clinical cardiologist with a number of laboratory tests for defining the molecular diagnosis , assessing new risk factors , and better targeting the pharmaceutical approaches in patients with cardiovascular disease."
18601595,"In this review , we first present the general characteristics of a biomarker followed by the analytical and clinical performance of assay methods."
23283365,"A cloned transgenic minipig model of hypercholesterolemia and accelerated atherosclerosis could accelerate discovery of new therapies for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( Al - Mashhadi et al. , this issue )."
24328889,Background : Business cycles affect people 's lives.
24328889,A growing literature examines their effect on health outcomes.
24328889,The available studies on the relationship between ambient economic conditions and cardiovascular health show mixed results.
24328889,"They are furthermore limited in their outcome measures , focusing mostly on mortality."
24328889,"Methods : We examined the relationship between economic conditions and cardiovascular disease and hypertension , using the Icelandic economic collapse of 2008."
24328889,Logit regression analyses are used to examine the relationship between economic conditions and the probability of reporting a cardiovascular disease or hypertension.
24328889,We furthermore investigated potential mediators of this relationship.
24328889,The data used come from a health and lifestyle survey carried out by the Public Health Institute of Iceland in 2007 and 2009.
24328889,Results : The crisis was positively related to hypertension in males but no statistically significant relationship was found for females.
24328889,"The mediation analyses indicated partial mediation through changes in working hours and stress level , but negligible mediation through changes in income."
24328889,"The male hypertension was , however , suppressed by concurrent changes in smoking and body weight."
24328889,Conclusions : Only examining mortality effects of society - wide economic conditions may understate the overall effect on cardiovascular health.
6535244,This paper reviews a number of studies which have presented results on the association between shift work and cardiovascular disease.
6535244,It is suggested that many of the early studies suffer from methodological flaws which render them difficult to interpret.
6535244,"In studies in which incidence of disease has been computed and related to exposure to shift work , the results indicate a higher risk for cardiovascular disease among shift workers as compared to day workers."
6535244,"The evidence can not yet , however , be considered conclusive."
8166990,"The WHO Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease ( MONICA ) Project was initiated in the early 1980s with the main objective of assessing the extent to which trends in coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are related to changes in known risk factors , daily living habits , health care , or major socioeconomic features in defined communities in different countries."
8166990,In 1994 the WHO / MONICA Project will have completed its 10 - year course.
8166990,"To develop a strategy of integrating cardiovascular disease indicators in an overall health indicator system , the problems and opportunities of cardiovascular disease monitoring have to be assessed now."
8166990,"In the industrialized world , cardiovascular diseases are still the most important cause of death."
8166990,"According to WHO estimations , chronic diseases in general will soon , as in the developing areas of the world , be the major health problem."
8166990,"As has been the case for a long time now in the field of cancer , the international community should consider whether , based on the experience of the WHO / MONICA Project , there should be a permanent institution charged with the worldwide monitoring of the development of cardiovascular diseases."
24726001,Cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world.
24726001,"Although much progress has been made for cardiovascular diseases in diagnosis , treatment and prognosis during the past two decades , the clinical need for a novel diagnostic biomarker and new therapeutic interventions to decrease the cardiovascular disease incidence is ongoing."
24726001,"MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are endogenous , small ( ∼ 22 nucleotides ) , single - stranded , non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are detectable in whole blood , serum , plasma , urine and other body fluids in a highly stable form."
24726001,Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs are potential novel biomarkers with high sensitivity for early diagnosis and modern treatment for cardiovascular diseases.
24726001,"Altered circulating miRNAs expressions have been reported in acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , stable coronary artery disease , heart failure , atherosclerosis , essential hypertension and stroke."
24726001,"In the present review , we examine more recent data regarding circulating miRNAs and their potential roles in diagnosis , prognosis and therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases."
24726001,"In addition , we briefly present our own recent experience in detecting circulating miRNAs , and the significance of these miRNAs in AMI prognosis."
15458691,Background : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is the leading killer for human.
15458691,"In order to understand the linkage between cardiovascular diseases and genes or proteins , it is essential to construct a database to organize the body of knowledge."
15458691,"While the existing molecular biological databases focus on the sequence and structural aspects of biological macromolecules , i.e. DNAs , RNAs and proteins , Cardio is the web - based system we built to provide a knowledge environment with visual interface to integrate information about major cardiovascular diseases in relation to genes and proteins."
15458691,Methods : We collected the information from the web by using a group of software we developed and used a relational database management system to manage the information of these data.
15458691,"Results : Cardio consists of six sections : GENE , PROTEIN , DISEASE , DRUG , LINKS , and REFERENCE."
15458691,Each section contains relevant information about the topic.
15458691,"Using a phenotype - driven approach , we can identify genetic mechanisms underlying the physiology and pathophysiology of specific cardiovascular disease , such as atherosclerosis , hypertension , heart failure , and stroke."
15458691,"Conclusion : The website titled "" Database of Genes and Proteins Related to Cardiovascular Disease ( Cardio ) "" is available at along with additional information on cardiovascular disease , supplementary materials and related figures."
8088093,"CPX testing allows for the objective assessment of aerobic capacity , anaerobic threshold , and the ventilatory response to exercise in patients with cardiovascular disease."
8088093,"These results can be used to assess severity of disease , its progression over time , prognosis , candidacy for transplantation , and response to therapy."
8088093,CPX testing can also serve to distinguish cardiac from ventilatory causes of exertional dyspnea.
2495541,Many patients seen in a primary care practice have multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
2495541,"In evaluating these patients , it is important for primary care clinicians to understand the principles of multiple risk factor assessment."
2495541,"Although none of the large - scale randomized primary prevention trials have convincingly proven the benefits of multiple risk factor intervention , some practical guidelines reflecting the current state of information are presented."
1772731,"As the life expectancy of women increases , a greater percentage of women 's lives will be spent in the menopause."
1772731,The greatest cause of morbidity and mortality during that period is cardiovascular disease.
1772731,"The associated risks that predispose to the development of cardiovascular disease are multifactoral and include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , smoking , obesity , family history , and elevated cholesterol levels."
1772731,"The menopause , per se , is associated with an increased risk because of the unfavorable changes in cholesterol metabolism secondary to estrogen deprivation."
1772731,The replacement of estrogen to menopausal women is believed to improve the lipid profile and reduce the atherogenic changes that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.
1772731,"However , this form of preventative therapy is futile unless other factors that promote cardiovascular disease also are modified."
1772731,"Such modification may be achieved by following a well - balanced diet , combined with an exercise program , cessation of smoking , weight control , and the monitoring of blood pressure and diabetes in high - risk patients."
16525531,Heartwatch is a national program in Irish general practice for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
16525531,"The program -- a joint initiative of the Irish Department of Health and Children , the Irish College of General Practitioners , and the Irish Heart Foundation -- has a number of key components , many of which may be suitable for adapting to Australian primary care."
3342425,Developing countries are subject to the same risks that have contributed to the high incidence of cardiovascular diseases in the already developed countries.
3342425,Improvements in life expectancy at birth lead to predictable shifts in the cause - of - death structure over time.
3342425,"The stage at which cardiovascular diseases may be considered to be ' actively emerging ' corresponds to a life expectancy level between 50 and 60 years and , at this level , cardiovascular disease mortality accounts for 15 - 25 % of all deaths."
3342425,The average life expectancy at birth in developing countries for the year 2000 is projected to be 60 years or more and it may be expected that by that time cardiovascular diseases would be actively emerging or established in virtually every country.
3342425,"In many developing countries today , life - style pattern that is associated with high rates of coronary heart disease is not yet widespread and it is therefore logical that a strategy of prevention should include efforts to inhibit the entrenchment and spread of unhealthy life - styles in the community ( i.e. , primordial prevention )."
3342425,"At the country level , cardiovascular disease prevention and control can not be considered in isolation and must be related to prevailing national health priorities and competing claims from other sectors of development."
3342425,In poorer countries where life expectancy is below 50 years primordial prevention activities are likely to be restricted -- perhaps to smoking and hypertension control.
3342425,In middle - income countries a broader based approach to primordial prevention is feasible and is more likely to be acceptable.
11151801,Cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) is the main empirically evaluated from of psychological therapy.
11151801,When applied to cardiovascular disease it can be directed at preventing the occurrence or recurrence of disease or at altering the psychological consequences of disease.
11151801,"Prevention can be achieved through the modification of behavioural risk factors ( e.g. smoking , diet ) or by attempting to directly modify the psychological processes involved in atherogenesis and thrombogenesis."
11151801,"Successful applications of CBT in cardiovascular disease are described , some the remaining problems indicated and new directions for research pointed out."
9085391,Background : During the past 20 years the age - standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rate has declined in Finland by 50 %.
9085391,The aim of this study was to examine the social cost consequences of this decline.
9085391,Methods : The prevalence - based cost - of - illness analysis was applied to estimate both direct and indirect costs of cardiovascular disease in 5 - year intervals from 1972 to 1992 ( in 1992 prices ).
9085391,"Summary data from the national registers covered all persons with cardiovascular disease who were treated , received sickness insurance benefits , or died from the disease."
9085391,"Results : Direct health care costs increased , but the decline in indirect costs overcompensated that increase."
9085391,"The total cost among all persons age 35 and over , including the retired , was $ 2.7 billion in 1972 and $ 2.6 billion in 1992 , which is a 4 % decrease."
9085391,In the age group of 35 - 64 years the total costs fell from $ 2.5 billion to $ 1.9 billion ( 25 % ).
9085391,In terms of cost per capita the decline was 26 and 40 % in the respective age groups.
9085391,Conclusions : The costs of cardiovascular disease decreased since 1972.
9085391,"However , total costs declined clearly less than the cardiovascular disease mortality rate."
9085391,"This implies that considerable savings in total costs , especially in direct health care costs , may not be expected as a result of even very successful prevention programs."
7427384,"Booklets from several countries on various aspects of cardiovascular disease , intended for distribution to the public and to patients , could be classified into three categories dealing with primary prevention , secondary prevention , and management."
7427384,"Much material was duplicated , whereas some diseases were completely ignored."
7427384,Only two types of booklets should be available.
7427384,"One would deal with preventive measures for all cardiovascular diseases , while the other would be a series of booklets on individual conditions , combining information on secondary prevention and on management."
27492514,Background : The precise coordination between breathing and swallowing is an important mechanism to prevent pulmonary aspiration.
27492514,"Factors that alter breathing patterns and ventilation , such as chronic respiratory diseases , may influence that precise coordination of breathing and swallowing."
27492514,Purpose : The purpose of this systematic literature review is to examine the effects of chronic respiratory diseases on swallowing function.
27492514,Method : Literature searches were performed using the electronic databases PubMed and Embase.
27492514,All articles meeting the eligibility criteria up to March 2016 were included.
27492514,Results : All articles included studied Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases ( COPD ) or Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) ; no studies involving other respiratory diseases were found.
27492514,"A total of 1069 abstracts were retrieved , of which twenty - six studies met the inclusion criteria ; eleven studies dealt with OSA and fifteen studies dealt with COPD."
27492514,Conclusion : The outcome data indicate that chronic respiratory diseases increase the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia ( OD ) in patients.
27492514,"However , the relative small number of studies , differences in selection criteria , definitions and assessment techniques used for diagnosing OSA , COPD , and OD point to the need for further research."
30975495,"The composition of the lung microbiome is increasingly well characterised , with changes in microbial diversity or abundance observed in association with several chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma , cystic fibrosis , bronchiectasis , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
30975495,"However , the precise effects of the microbiome on pulmonary health and the functional mechanisms by which it regulates host immunity are only now beginning to be elucidated."
30975495,"Bacteria , viruses , and fungi from both the upper and lower respiratory tract produce structural ligands and metabolites that interact with the host and alter the development and progression of chronic respiratory diseases."
30975495,"Here , we review recent advances in our understanding of the composition of the lung microbiome , including the virome and mycobiome , the mechanisms by which these microbes interact with host immunity , and their functional effects on the pathogenesis , exacerbations , and comorbidities of chronic respiratory diseases."
30975495,"We also describe the present understanding of how respiratory microbiota can influence the efficacy of common therapies for chronic respiratory disease , and the potential of manipulation of the microbiome as a therapeutic strategy."
30975495,"Finally , we highlight some of the limitations in the field and propose how these could be addressed in future research."
30219316,Background : India has 18 % of the global population and an increasing burden of chronic respiratory diseases.
30219316,"However , a systematic understanding of the distribution of chronic respiratory diseases and their trends over time is not readily available for all of the states of India."
30219316,Our aim was to report the trends in the burden of chronic respiratory diseases and the heterogeneity in their distribution in all states of India between 1990 and 2016.
30219316,"Methods : Using all accessible data from multiple sources , we estimated the prevalence of major chronic respiratory diseases and the deaths and disability - adjusted life - years ( DALYs ) caused by them for every state of India from 1990 to 2016 as part of the Global Burden of Diseases , Injuries , and Risk Factors Study ( GBD ) 2016."
30219316,We assessed heterogeneity in the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and asthma across the states of India.
30219316,The states were categorised into four groups based on their epidemiological transition level ( ETL ).
30219316,"ETL was defined as the ratio of DALYs from communicable diseases to those from non-communicable diseases and injuries combined , with a low ratio denoting high ETL and vice versa."
30219316,We also assessed the contribution of risk factors to DALYs due to COPD.
30219316,We compared the burden of chronic respiratory diseases in India against the global average in GBD 2016.
30219316,We calculated 95 % uncertainty intervals ( UIs ) for the point estimates.
30219316,Findings : The contribution of chronic respiratory diseases to the total DALYs in India increased from 4 · 5 % ( 95 % UI 4 · 0 - 4 · 9 ) in 1990 to 6 · 4 % ( 5 · 8 - 7 · 0 ) in 2016.
30219316,"Of the total global DALYs due to chronic respiratory diseases in 2016 , 32 · 0 % occurred in India."
30219316,"COPD and asthma were responsible for 75 · 6 % and 20 · 0 % of the chronic respiratory disease DALYs , respectively , in India in 2016."
30219316,"The number of cases of COPD in India increased from 28 · 1 million ( 27 · 0 - 29 · 2 ) in 1990 to 55 · 3 million ( 53 · 1 - 57 · 6 ) in 2016 , an increase in prevalence from 3 · 3 % ( 3 · 1 - 3 · 4 ) to 4 · 2 % ( 4 · 0 - 4 · 4 )."
30219316,The age - standardised COPD prevalence and DALY rates in 2016 were highest in the less developed low ETL state group.
30219316,"There were 37 · 9 million ( 35 · 7 - 40 · 2 ) cases of asthma in India in 2016 , with similar prevalence in the four ETL state groups , but the highest DALY rate was in the low ETL state group."
30219316,The highest DALY rates for both COPD and asthma in 2016 were in the low ETL states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
30219316,"The DALYs per case of COPD and asthma were 1 · 7 and 2 · 4 times higher in India than the global average in 2016 , respectively ; most states had higher rates compared with other locations worldwide at similar levels of Socio - demographic Index."
30219316,"Of the DALYs due to COPD in India in 2016 , 53 · 7 % ( 43 · 1 - 65 · 0 ) were attributable to air pollution , 25 · 4 % ( 19 · 5 - 31 · 7 ) to tobacco use , and 16 · 5 % ( 14 · 1 - 19 · 2 ) to occupational risks , making these the leading risk factors for COPD."
30219316,Interpretation : India has a disproportionately high burden of chronic respiratory diseases.
30219316,"The increasing contribution of these diseases to the overall disease burden across India and the high rate of health loss from them , especially in the less developed low ETL states , highlights the need for focused policy interventions to address this significant cause of disease burden in India."

28509852,The management of patients with chronic respiratory diseases affected by difficult to treat infections has become a challenge in clinical practice.
28509852,"Conditions such as cystic fibrosis ( CF ) and non-CF bronchiectasis require extensive treatment strategies to deal with multidrug resistant pathogens that include Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , Burkholderia species and non-tuberculous Mycobacteria ( NTM )."
28509852,"These challenges prompted scientists to deliver antimicrobial agents through the pulmonary system by using inhaled , aerosolized or nebulized antibiotics."
28509852,Subsequent research advances focused on the development of antibiotic agents able to achieve high tissue concentrations capable of reducing the bacterial load of difficult - to - treat organisms in hosts with chronic respiratory conditions.
28509852,"In this review , we focus on the evidence regarding the use of antibiotic therapies administered through the respiratory system via inhalation , nebulization or aerosolization , specifically in patients with chronic respiratory diseases that include CF , non-CF bronchiectasis and NTM."
28509852,"However , further research is required to address the potential benefits , mechanisms of action and applications of inhaled antibiotics for the management of difficult - to - treat infections in patients with chronic respiratory diseases."
31149852,"Rationale : Workplace inhalational hazards remain common worldwide , even though they are ameliorable."
31149852,"Previous American Thoracic Society documents have assessed the contribution of workplace exposures to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on a population level , but not to other chronic respiratory diseases."
31149852,"The goal of this document is to report an in - depth literature review and data synthesis of the occupational contribution to the burden of the major nonmalignant respiratory diseases , including airway diseases ; interstitial fibrosis ; hypersensitivity pneumonitis ; other noninfectious granulomatous lung diseases , including sarcoidosis ; and selected respiratory infections."
31149852,Methods : Relevant literature was identified for each respiratory condition.
31149852,The occupational population attributable fraction ( PAF ) was estimated for those conditions for which there were sufficient population - based studies to allow pooled estimates.
31149852,"For the other conditions , the occupational burden of disease was estimated on the basis of attribution in case series , incidence rate ratios , or attributable fraction within an exposed group."
31149852,"Results : Workplace exposures contribute substantially to the burden of multiple chronic respiratory diseases , including asthma ( PAF , 16 % ) ; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( PAF , 14 % ) ; chronic bronchitis ( PAF , 13 % ) ; idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( PAF , 26 % ) ; hypersensitivity pneumonitis ( occupational burden , 19 % ) ; other granulomatous diseases , including sarcoidosis ( occupational burden , 30 % ) ; pulmonary alveolar proteinosis ( occupational burden , 29 % ) ; tuberculosis ( occupational burden , 2.3 % in silica - exposed workers and 1 % in healthcare workers ) ; and community - acquired pneumonia in working - age adults ( PAF , 10 % )."
31149852,Conclusions : Workplace exposures contribute to the burden of disease across a range of nonmalignant lung conditions in adults ( in addition to the 100 % burden for the classic occupational pneumoconioses ).
31149852,"This burden has important clinical , research , and policy implications."
31149852,There is a pressing need to improve clinical recognition and public health awareness of the contribution of occupational factors across a range of nonmalignant respiratory diseases.
32046720,Background : Chronic respiratory diseases ( CRDs ) are leading causes of morbidity worldwide.
32046720,"However , the spatial and temporal trends in prevalence and incidence of CRDs have not been estimated."
32046720,"Methods : Based on data from the Global Burden of Diseases , Injuries , and Risk Factors Study 2017 , we analyzed the prevalence and incidence trends of CRDs from 1990 to 2017 according to age , sex , region and disease pattern."
32046720,"Furthermore , the correlations between the incidence and the World Bank income levels , sociodemographic index ( SDI ) , and human development index ( HDI ) levels were analyzed to assess the factors affecting incidence."
32046720,"Result : The total number of CRD cases increased by 39.5 % from 1990 to 2017 , nevertheless , the age - standardized prevalence rate ( ASPR ) and age - standardized incidence rate ( ASIR ) showed decreasing trends."
32046720,"The ASIRs of CRD , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , pneumoconiosis , and asthma decreased , whereas the ASIR of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis increased during the past 27 years."
32046720,"Significant differences between males and females in the incidence rates of pneumoconiosis , interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis were observed."
32046720,"Elderly people especially suffered from CRDs , except for asthma."
32046720,"For COPD , the ASIR decreased from low - SDI regions to high - SDI regions."
32046720,The ASIR of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis in the high - SDI region was highest and have increased mostly.
32046720,The ASIRs for pneumoconiosis and asthma were inversely related to the HDI.
32046720,"Conclusions : In 2017 , CRDs were still the leading causes of morbidity worldwide."
32046720,A large proportion of the disease burden was attributed to asthma and COPD.
32046720,The incidence rates of all four types of CRDs varied greatly across the world.
32046720,Statistically significant correlation was found between the ASIR and SDI / HDI.
32707480,"With first cases noted towards the end of 2019 in China , COVID - 19 infection was rapidly become a devastating pandemic."
32707480,"Even if most patients present with a mild to moderate form of the disease , the estimated prevalence of COVID -19-related severe acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) is 15 - 20 % and 2 - 12 % needed intubation and mechanical ventilation."
32707480,In addition to mechanical ventilation some other techniques of respiratory support could be used in some forms of COVID - 19 related ARF.
32707480,"This position paper of the Respiratory Support and Chronic Care Group of the French Society of Respiratory Diseases is intended to help respiratory clinicians involved in care of COVID - 19 pandemic in the rational use of non-invasive techniques such as oxygen therapy , CPAP , non-invasive ventilation and high flow oxygen therapy in managing patients outside intensive care unit ( ICU )."
32707480,The aims are : ( 1 ) to focus both on the place of each technique and in describing practical tips ( types of devices and circuit assemblies ) aimed to limit the risk of caregivers when using those techniques at high risk spreading of viral particles ; ( 2 ) to propose a step - by - step strategy to manage ARF outside ICU.
29112181,Pulmonary diseases are one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality.
29112181,"Although vitamin D is best known for its role in calcium , phosphorus , and bone homeostasis , it has gained attention in the recent years because of a wide range of extraskeletal effects , including its immunomodulatory and antibacterial potential."
29112181,"Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in chronic pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , cystic fibrosis , tuberculosis , and asthma , and several clinical studies have been conducted investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease outcomes."
29112181,"In this review , we searched for positive evidence on vitamin D supplementation from randomized controlled trials and elaborated on the optimal serum vitamin D levels and dosing regimens for an effective intervention."
29112181,"While vitamin D supplementation seems to be beneficial as an add ‑ on treatment for adult patients with asthma and a potent intervention to reduce exacerbations in patients with COPD , there is little evidence for its therapeutic use in cystic fibrosis , pneumonia , and tuberculosis."
31704266,Nuclear factor erythroid 2 - related factor ( Nrf ) 2 is a transcription factor that integrates cellular stress signals by directing various transcriptional programs.
31704266,"As an evolutionarily conserved intracellular defense mechanism , Nrf2 and its endogenous inhibitor Kelch - like ECH - associated protein ( Keap ) 1 inhibit oxidative stress in the lung , which is the internal organ that is continuously exposed to the environment."
31704266,"Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases including asthma , acute lung injury , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , and interstitial lung disease ( ILD )."
31704266,"Thus , Nrf2 is considered as a potential therapeutic target in lung diseases owing to its antioxidant effect."
31704266,"Nrf2 also plays a complex role in lung cancer , acting as a tumor suppressor and promoter ; recent studies have revealed the tumor - promoting effects of Nrf2 in tumors that have undergone malignant transformation."
31704266,"Lung cancer - associated mutations in Keap1 disrupt Keap1 - Nrf2 complex formation , resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of Keap1 , and the constitutive activation of Nrf2."
31704266,"In lung cancer cells , persistently high nuclear Nrf2 levels induce the expression of genes that contribute to metabolic reprogramming , and stimulate cell proliferation."
31704266,"In this review , we outlined the major functions of Nrf2 , and discussed its importance in pulmonary diseases such as asthma , acute respiratory distress syndrome , and lung cancer."
31704266,Elucidating the mechanisms through which Nrf2 modulates the initiation and progression of pulmonary diseases can lead to the development of therapeutics specifically targeting this pathway.
25676797,"A relevant proportion of children and adults with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) have a marked decrease in exercise tolerance , which can be partly related to impaired muscle function and decreased physical activity levels in daily life , in addition to lung disease."
25676797,Preliminary findings suggest that patients with non-CF bronchiectasis face the same problems.
25676797,These patients might be excellent candidates for exercise and physical activity interventions.
25676797,"This review elaborates on the rationale for exercise training and activity behaviour changes and summarizes the existing evidence for these rehabilitation strategies in patients with bronchiectasis , both CF and non-CF bronchiectasis."
25676797,"Furthermore , practical considerations and safety aspects are discussed."
29109233,Background : Advance care planning ( ACP ) supports patients in identifying and documenting their preferences and timely discussing them with their relatives and healthcare professionals ( HCPs ).
29109233,"Since the British Thoracic Society encourages ACP in chronic respiratory disease , the objective was to systematically review ACP practice in chronic respiratory disease , attitudes of patients and HCPs and barriers and facilitators related to engagement in ACP."
29109233,Methods : We systematically searched 12 electronic databases for empirical studies on ACP in adults with chronic respiratory diseases.
29109233,Identified studies underwent full review and data extraction.
29109233,"Results : Of 2509 studies , 21 were eligible : 10 were quantitative studies."
29109233,"Although a majority of patients was interested in engaging in ACP , ACP was rarely carried out."
29109233,Many HCPs acknowledged the importance of ACP but were hesitant to initiate it.
29109233,"Barriers to engagement in ACP were the complex disease course of patients with chronic respiratory diseases , HCPs ' concern of taking away patients ' hopes and lack of continuity of care."
29109233,The identification of trigger points and training of HCPs on how to communicate sensitive topics were identified as facilitators to engagement in ACP.
29109233,"Conclusions : In conclusion , ACP is surprisingly uncommon in chronic respiratory disease , possibly due to the complex disease course of chronic respiratory diseases and ambivalence of both patients and HCPs to engage in ACP."
29109233,Providing patients with information about their disease can help meeting their needs.
29109233,"Additionally , support of HCPs through identification of trigger points , training and system - related changes can facilitate engagement in ACP."
29109233,Systematic review registration number : CRD42016039787.
27557670,"Asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cystic fibrosis , and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , are among the most common chronic diseases and their prevalence is increasing."
27557670,Each of these diseases is characterized by the secretion of cytokines and pro-inflammatory molecules which are thought to play a critical role in their pathogenesis.
27557670,"Moreover , immune cells , particularly neutrophils , macrophages and dendritic cells as well structural cells such as epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells are also involved in the pathogenic cycle of these diseases."
27557670,"There is a pressing need for the development of new therapies for these pulmonary diseases , particularly as no existing treatment has been shown to reduce disease progression."
27557670,"HMGB1 ( high - mobility group box 1 ) , originally identified as a nuclear non histone protein with DNA - binding domains can be secreted by living and dying cells and it is now regarded as an important endogenous danger signaling molecule."
27557670,"Besides as a signal of tissue injury , HMGB1 is considered a powerful mediator of inflammation and high levels of HMGB1 are found in chronic lung diseases."
27557670,The role of HMGB1 in respiratory diseases is still elusive nevertheless these studies suggest an involvement of this cytokine in their pathogenesis.
27557670,"Nucleic acid - based drugs ( NABDs ) are a novel class of pharmaceuticals including antisense oligonucleotides , DNA - zymes , and RNA interference as mediated by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , which are used to dampen the expression of disease - causing genes having therapeutic potential for controlling chronic airway diseases."
27557670,"Due to their inherent difficulties , such as for example sensitivity to endonucleases , their delivery in vivo should be assured by vectors."
27557670,Non-viral lipid - and polymer - based nanosystems have acquired much importance in this context.
27557670,"In this review , we will discuss these emerging tools in gene therapy of chronic lung diseases , particularly the use of siRNA in the down - regulation of critical molecules in the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases , with particular emphasis on HMGB1 as therapeutic target."
28933768,"The aim of the study is to investigate the epidemiological situation regarding chronic respiratory diseases in populations that inhabit different climatic - geographical regions of Russia , and to develop targeted programs for prevention of these diseases."
28933768,"Methods : ( 1 ) a comparative analysis of the standardized mortality data in Russia and other selected regions of the Russian North using the European standard for respiratory diseases , in a population aged 25 - 64 ; and ( 2 ) data from a randomized cross-sectional epidemiological study , with subjects from three different climatic - geographical regions of Russia."
28933768,Results : ( 1 ) the respiratory disease - related mortality rates in the majority of Russian Northern regions were much higher compared to the national average.
28933768,"Although death rates from chronic lower respiratory diseases were higher among the Northern regions and in the whole of Russia relative to the countries of European Union ( EU ) , the cause of death in the populations of the Northern regions tend to be lower respiratory infections and pneumonia ; and ( 2 ) despite the absence of any significant differences in the prevalence of smoking , the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases ( COPD ) is significantly higher in Far North Yakutsk compared to the other two regions in this study - Chelyabinsk and Vologda."
28933768,The status of hyperborean had the highest chance of a significant contribution to COPD and cardiorespiratory pathology among all other risk factors.
28933768,The results revealed a need for effective targeted strategies for primary and secondary prevention of chronic respiratory diseases for the populations of the Northern regions of Russia.
28933768,"Conclusions : The revealed regional distinctions regarding the prevalence of , and mortality from , chronic respiratory diseases should be taken into consideration when designing integrated programs for chronic non-communicable disease prevention in these regions."
26071979,Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) frequently occurs in association with chronic respiratory diseases although the casual link is not always clear.
26071979,Several pathophysiological and experimental factors are considered to support a role for GERD in respiratory disease.
26071979,"Conversely , respiratory diseases and bronchodilator treatment can themselves exacerbate GERD."
26071979,"When cough or severe asthma is being investigated , GERD does not need to be systematically looked for and a therapeutic test with proton pump inhibitors is not always recommended."
26071979,"pH impedance monitoring is now the reference diagnostic tool to detect non acid reflux , a form of reflux for which proton pump inhibitor treatment is ineffective."
26071979,"Recent data have shown a potential role of GERD in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiolitis obliterans following lung transplantation , leading to discussions about the place of surgery in this context."
26071979,"However , studies using pH impedance monitoring are still needed to better understand and manage the association between GERD and chronic respiratory diseases."
25519785,"With an aging global population , chronic respiratory diseases are becoming a more prominent cause of death and disability."
25519785,"Age - standardised death rates from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) are highest in low - income regions of the world , particularly South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa , although airflow obstruction is relatively uncommon in these areas."
25519785,"Airflow obstruction is , by contrast , more common in regions with a high prevalence of cigarette smoking."
25519785,"COPD mortality is much more closely related to the prevalence of a low forced vital capacity which is , in turn , associated with poverty."
25519785,"Mortality from asthma is less common than mortality from COPD , but it is also relatively more common in poorer areas , particularly Oceania , South and South - East Asia , the Middle East and Africa."
25519785,"Again this contrasts with the asthma prevalence among adults , which is highest in high - income regions."
25519785,"In high - income areas , mortality due to asthma , which is predominantly an adult problem , has fallen substantially in recent decades with the spread of new guidelines for treatment that emphasise the use of inhaled steroids to control the disease."
25519785,"Although mortality rates have been falling , the prevalence of atopy has been increasing between generations in Western Europe."
25519785,Changes in the prevalence of wheeze among adults has been more varied and may have been influenced by the reduction in smoking and the increase in the use of inhaled steroids.
30615663,"Introduction : Chronic respiratory diseases in Tanzania are prevalent and a silent burden to the affected population , and healthcare system."
30615663,We aimed to explore the availability of services and level of health facilities readiness to provide management of chronic respiratory diseases and its associated factors.
30615663,Methods : The current study is a secondary analysis of the 2014 - 2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey data.
30615663,"Facilities were considered to have a high readiness to provide management of chronic respiratory diseases if they scored at least half ( ≥ 50 % ) of the indicators listed in each of the three domains ( staff training and guideline , equipment , and basic medicines ) as identified by World Health Organization - Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual."
30615663,"Descriptive , unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed."
30615663,A P value < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance.
30615663,"Results : Out of 723 facilities included in this analysis , approximately one - tenth had a high readiness to provide management of chronic respiratory diseases."
30615663,Less than 10 % of the facilities had at least one staff who received training for management of chronic respiratory diseases.
30615663,"In an adjusted model , privately owned facilities [ AOR = 3.3 ; 95 % CI , 1.5 - 7.5 ] , hospitals [ AOR = 11.6 ; 95 % CI , 5.0 - 27.2 ] , health centres [ AOR = 5.0 ; 95 % CI , 2.4 - 10.7 ] , and performance of routine management meeting [ AOR = 3.3 ; 95 % CI , 1.4 - 7.8 ] were significantly associated with high readiness to provide management for chronic respiratory diseases."
30615663,Conclusion : Majority of Tanzanian health facilities have low readiness to provide management for chronic respiratory diseases.
30615663,"There is a need for the Tanzanian government to increase the availability of diagnostic equipment , medication , and to provide refresher training specifically in the lower - level and public health facilities for better management of chronic respiratory diseases and other non-communicable diseases."
29716592,Pollution is known to cause and exacerbate a number of chronic respiratory diseases.
29716592,The World Health Organisation has placed air pollution as the world 's largest environmental health risk factor.
29716592,"There has been recent publicity about the role for diet and anti-oxidants in mitigating the effects of pollution , and this review assesses the evidence for alterations in diet , including vitamin supplementation in abrogating the effects of pollution on asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases."
29716592,"We found evidence to suggest that carotenoids , vitamin D and vitamin E help protect against pollution damage which can trigger asthma , COPD and lung cancer initiation."
29716592,"Vitamin C , curcumin , choline and omega - 3 fatty acids may also play a role."
29716592,The Mediterranean diet appears to be of benefit in patients with airways disease and there appears to be a beneficial effect in smokers however there is no direct evidence regarding protecting against air pollution.
29716592,More studies investigating the effects of nutrition on rapidly rising air pollution are urgently required.
29716592,"However it is very difficult to design such studies due to the confounding factors of diet , obesity , co-morbid illness , medication and environmental exposure."
28801791,"Coordination of healthcare effectively prevents exacerbations and reduces the number of hospitalizations , emergency visits , and the mortality rate in patients with chronic respiratory diseases."
28801791,The purpose of this study was to determine clinical effectiveness of ambulatory healthcare coordination in chronic respiratory patients and its effect on the level of healthcare services as an indicator of direct medical costs.
28801791,"We conducted a retrospective health record survey , using an online database of 550 patients with chronic respiratory diseases."
28801791,"There were decreases in breathing rate , heart rate , and the number of cigarettes smoked per day , and forced vital capacity ( FVC ) and forced expired volume in 1 s ( FEV1 ) increased after the implementation of the coordinated healthcare structure."
28801791,"These benefits were accompanied by increases in the number of visits to the pulmonary outpatient clinic ( p < 0.001 ) , diagnostic costs ( p < 0.001 ) , and referrals to other outpatient clinics ( p < 0.003 ) and hospitals ( p < 0.001 )."
28801791,The advantageous effects of healthcare coordination on clinical status of respiratory patients above outlined persisted over a 3 - year period being reviewed.
32264856,Background : Work - related respiratory disorders are major contributors to the global burden of respiratory diseases.
32264856,"Agricultural workers are exposed to a number of dusts , which may contribute to the development of respiratory disorders."
32264856,"However , the knowledge about the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function status in African farmers was limited."
32264856,This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function status of Ethiopian farmers exposed to farming activities.
32264856,Methods : A community based comparative cross sectional study was conducted among 288 agricultural workers ( farmers ) aged 18 to 65 years and 288 control subjects ( non-agricultural workers ).
32264856,Data were collected by interviewer administered structured questionnaires adopted from British Medical Research Council respiratory questionnaire and American Thoracic Society Division of Lung Diseases questionnaire.
32264856,"Moreover , all study participants underwent spirometry."
32264856,"Results : The prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms was higher in farmers than in controls , with significant difference for cough ( 20.5 % vs. 9.0 % , p = 0.001 ) and phlegm ( 19.1 % vs. 9.0 % , p = 0.001 )."
32264856,Chronic respiratory symptoms among farmers were significantly associated with duration of agricultural exposure ( p = 0.014 ).
32264856,"The mean values of all spirometric parameters were lower in farmers than in controls with significant difference for FVC , FEV1 , FEF25 % , FEF50 % , FEF25 - 75 % and PEFR."
32264856,"Moreover , the mean values of all spirometric parameters of farmers have found to be decreased with increased duration of workplace exposure."
32264856,"Lung function test results also showed a higher prevalence of obstructive ( 15.6 % vs. 10.8 % , p = 0.085 ) and restrictive type ( 12.8 % vs. 3.1 % , p < 0.001 ) of pulmonary function impairment in farmers than in controls."
32264856,"However , the difference was not significant for obstructive type of impairment."
32264856,Conclusion : This study indicated that farmers are at high risk for the development of chronic respiratory symptoms and reduced pulmonary function indices.
32264856,"Hence , a comprehensive occupational safety practices are important to maintain the respiratory health of farmers."
24447429,There has been growing interest in recent years in the extraosseous effects of vitamin D.
24447429,"In this article , we review the physiology of vitamin D , the physiopathological effects associated with vitamin D deficit and the available evidence on its etiopathogenic role in respiratory diseases."
24447429,"Given the pleiotropic actions of vitamin D , it is biologically plausible that the deficit of this vitamin could play a pathogenic role of in the development of various respiratory diseases."
24447429,"However , the many epidemiological studies that have shown an association between low vitamin D levels and a higher risk of developing various respiratory diseases or a poorer prognosis if they do appear , were unable to show causality."
24447429,"Post-hoc analyses of some clinical trials , particularly in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and asthma , appear to suggest that some patient subtypes may benefit from correction of a vitamin D deficit."
24447429,"In this respect , it would be interesting to determine if the interindividual differences found in the effect of vitamin D deficit and responses to correcting this deficit could be explained by the genetic variants involved in vitamin D metabolism."
24447429,"Ultimately , only appropriately designed clinical trials will determine whether 25 - OHD supplements can prevent or improve the course of the various respiratory diseases in which an epidemiological association between prognosis and vitamin D deficit has been described."
29927203,"Objective : To identify the prevalence , clinical characteristics , disease severity , and correlations of major chronic respiratory diseases ( CRDs ) among the adult population living in Chiang Mai."
29927203,Material and method : A cross-sectional study was conducted with adults living in municipal areas of Chiang Mai.
29927203,All clinical relevant data collected by face - to - face interview was confirmed by pulmonologists.
29927203,The chest radiographic findings and post-bronchodilator spirometry were done in all subjects.
29927203,The aeroallergen skin test and rhinoscopy were performed in all chronic rhinitis and asthma subjects.
29927203,"Results : Five hundred seventy four subjects with mean age 52.9 ± 10.0 years , 59.6 % female , and 37.5 % smokers were recruited."
29927203,The prevalence of overall CRDs was 59.2 %.
29927203,"Chronic rhinitis was the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease ( n = 239 , 41.6 % ) , followed by asthma ( n = 58 , 10.1 % ) , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ( n = 21 , 3.7 % )."
29927203,"The most common abnormal pulmonary function test was restrictive lung disorders ( n = 53 , 9.6 % )."
29927203,"Asthma subjects were determined to be more allergic than chronic rhinitis subjects ( 58.1 % vs. 39.9 % , p - value = 0.033 )."
29927203,"Regarding the disease severity , 14.9 % of chronic rhinitis and 10.3 % of asthma subjects were classified as moderate to severe degree , whereas 81 % of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects were classified as moderate to very severe degrees."
29927203,"In asthma patients , there were positive association with chronic rhinitis ( OR 3.9 , 95 % CI 2.1 - 7.0 , p - value < 0.001 )."
29927203,Conclusion : The prevalence of major CRDs in adults among Chiang Mai population was significantly high with overlapped respiratory symptoms and varying disease severity.
29927203,"Additionally , chronic rhinitis had correlation with asthma but not with COPD."
27573642,"Governments struggle to fund health services and there is a growing interest in the cost , clinical characteristics , and interventions for high utilizers of care , such as persistent frequent attenders to primary care."
27573642,The purpose of this study was to determine the components shaping the phenomenon of frequent attendance in patients with chronic respiratory diseases in primary care settings.
27573642,"We examined 200 adult patients with chronic diseases ( median age 65 , range 18 - 90 ) recruited from 126 general practitioners."
27573642,"We conclude that , in patients with chronic respiratory diseases , frequent attendance can be expected among those with a low level of satisfaction with their quality of health , a low level of QoL in the physical domain as much as QoL in the social relationships domain , making multiple visits to a doctor ( more than 4 visits ) , taking more than five drugs , being treated for more than three chronic diseases , waiting at the doctor 's office for no more than 30 min , receiving a greater number of primary care services , and requiring the assistance of a district nurse."
27573642,Such patients may need social support interventions and monitoring of their clinical status.
24563632,"Chronic lung diseases , such as cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , asthma , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) are incurable and represent a very high social burden."
24563632,Stem cell - based treatment may represent a hope for the cure of these diseases.
24563632,"In this paper , we revise the overall knowledge about the plasticity and engraftment of exogenous marrow - derived stem cells into the lung , as well as their usefulness in lung repair and therapy of chronic lung diseases."
24563632,"The lung is easily accessible and the pathophysiology of these diseases is characterized by injury , inflammation , and eventually by remodeling of the airways."
24563632,"Bone marrow - derived stem cells , including hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) and mesenchymal stromal ( stem ) cells ( MSCs ) , encompass a wide array of cell subsets with different capacities of engraftment and injured tissue regenerating potential."
24563632,"Proof - of - principle that marrow cells administered locally may engraft and give rise to specialized epithelial cells has been given , but the efficiency of this conversion is too limited to give a therapeutic effect."
24563632,"Besides the identification of plasticity mechanisms , the characterization / isolation of the stem cell subpopulations represents a major challenge to improving the efficacy of transplantation protocols used in regenerative medicine for lung diseases."
33181258,Background : Chronic respiratory diseases have become a non-negligible cause of death globally.
33181258,"Although smoking and environmental exposures are primary risk factors for chronic respiratory diseases , genetic factors also play an important role in determining individual 's susceptibility to diseases."
33181258,Here we performed integrated gene - based and pathway analyses to systematically illuminate the heritable characteristics of chronic respiratory diseases.
33181258,"Methods : UK ( United Kingdom ) Biobank is a very large , population - based prospective study with over 500,000 participants , established to allow detailed investigations of the genetic and nongenetic determinants of the diseases."
33181258,"Utilizing the GWAS - summarized data downloaded from UK Biobank , we conducted gene - based analysis to obtain associations of susceptibility genes with asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and pneumonia using FUSION and MAGMA software."
33181258,"Across the identified susceptibility regions , functional annotation integrating multiple functional data sources was performed to explore potential regulatory mechanisms with INQUISIT algorithm."
33181258,"To further detect the biological process involved in the development of chronic respiratory diseases , we undertook pathway enrichment analysis with the R package ( clusterProfiler )."
33181258,"Results : A total of 195 susceptibility genes were identified significantly associated with chronic respiratory diseases ( Pbonferroni < 0.05 ) , and 24/195 located out of known susceptibility regions ( e.g. WDPCP in 2p15 )."
33181258,"Within the identified susceptibility regions , functional annotation revealed an aggregation of credible variants in promoter - like and enhancer - like histone modification regions and such regulatory mechanisms were specific to lung tissues."
33181258,"Furthermore , 110 genes with INQUISIT score ≥ 1 may influence diseases susceptibility through exerting effects on coding sequences , proximal promoter and distal enhancer regulations."
33181258,Pathway enrichment results showed that these genes were enriched in immune - related processes and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors pathways.
33181258,Conclusions : This study implemented an integrated gene - based and pathway strategy to explore the underlying biological mechanisms and our findings may serve as promising targets for future clinical treatments of chronic respiratory diseases.
28189078,Anxiety and depression are two common psychological disorders with high morbidity worldwide.
28189078,Understanding of their prevalence of patients with chronic respiratory diseases is becoming more and more important for clinicians.
28189078,The current study aims at investigation of the prevalence and potential risk factors of anxiety and depression among patients with chronic respiratory diseases.
28189078,"The psychological status , anxiety and depression , and the relevant risk factors of 1713 patients with chronic respiratory diseases from 8 general hospitals in Jiangsu Province of China were evaluated."
28189078,"The results showed that the patients with chronic respiratory diseases experiencing depression and anxiety accounted for 46.00 % and 25.34 % , respectively."
28189078,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lower body mass index ( BMI ) , sleep disorders , limitation of physical activity , and negative life events were significantly associated with an increased risk of both depressive and anxiety symptoms."
28189078,"Poor marital status including divorce , separation and widowerhood was markedly correlated with an increased risk of depression , and chronic pain was with anxiety symptoms , respectively."
28189078,"Collectively , the data demonstrated that depression and anxiety were highly prevalent among the patients with chronic respiratory diseases."
28189078,It is greatly significant to take specific psychological measures to lower the incidence of depression and anxiety in these patients.
27358182,The literature lacks reports on the role of the social relationships domain ( SRD ) of quality of life ( QoL ) in shaping care for patients with chronic respiratory diseases in primary care.
27358182,In this study we examined a group of 582 patients with chronic respiratory diseases and chronic non-respiratory diseases recruited from 199 primary care centers.
27358182,"In the patients with chronic respiratory diseases , higher SRD correlated with more frequent patient visits due to medical issue , fewer district nurse interventions over the past 12 months , less frequent hospitalizations over the past 3 years , and fewer chronic diseases."
27358182,"In these patients , a high SRD was most effectively created by high QoL in the Psychological , Environmental , and Physical domains , and the satisfaction with QoL."
27358182,"Programs for preventing a decline in SRD should include patients with low scores in the Psychological , Environmental , and Physical domains , those who show no improvement in mental or somatic well - being in the past 12 months , those with a low level of positive mental attitudes , unhealthy eating habits , and with low levels of met needs."
27358182,"Such programs should include older widows and widowers without permanent relationships , with only primary education , living far from a primary care center , and those whose visits were not due to a medical issue."
17000252,Objective : This study was undertaken to examine the associations between maternal respiratory diseases and placental abruption.
17000252,"Study design : A population - based , retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the associations between maternal respiratory diseases and abruption in the United States."
17000252,"Data on women who delivered singleton births ( n = 37,314,022 ) were derived from the National Hospital Discharge Survey for the years 1993 to 2003."
17000252,"International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision , Clinical Modification ( ICD -9-CM ) codes were used to identify pregnant women hospitalized for acute upper respiratory diseases , viral and bacterial pneumonia , acute bronchitis , and acute bronchiolitis , chronic bronchitis , asthma , and abruption."
17000252,"Relative risk ( RR ) and 95 % CI were derived from multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the associations after adjusting for maternal age , race , marital status , smoking , cocaine use , adequacy of prenatal care , maternal insurance status , geographic location , and year of birth ( although data on smoking and cocaine use are likely underreported )."
17000252,"Results : The rate of abruption was 9.7 per 1,000 singleton births."
17000252,The overall rate for acute respiratory conditions was 2.2 per 1000 pregnancies.
17000252,"Acute upper respiratory diseases ( RR 3.2 , 95 % CI 3.0 - 3.4 ) and viral / bacterial pneumonia ( RR 2.2 , 95 % CI 1.9 - 2.4 ) were associated with abruption."
17000252,"The rate of chronic respiratory conditions was 9.0 per 1,000 pregnancies."
17000252,"Chronic bronchitis was strongly associated with abruption ( RR 31.8 , 95 % CI 29.6 - 34.3 ) , but the association between asthma and abruption was modest ( RR 1.1 , 95 % CI 1.0 - 1.2 )."
17000252,Stratified analysis by maternal race showed that asthma was associated with abruption among black women but not white women.
17000252,Conclusion : Pregnancies complicated by acute and chronic respiratory diseases requiring hospitalization are associated with placental abruption.
17701667,Objective : To examine whether acute and chronic respiratory diseases are associated with an increased risk of spontaneous premature rupture of the membranes ( PROM ).
17701667,Methods : We used the 1993 - 2004 National Hospital Discharge Survey data of singleton deliveries in the USA ( N = 41 250 539 ).
17701667,"The International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision was utilized to identify acute ( acute upper respiratory diseases , viral / bacterial pneumonia , and acute bronchitis / bronchiolitis ) and chronic ( chronic bronchitis and asthma ) respiratory conditions and spontaneous PROM."
17701667,All analyses were adjusted for potential confounders.
17701667,"Results : The incidence of PROM was 5 % , and rates of acute and chronic respiratory conditions were 2.1 and 9.5 per 1000 pregnancies , respectively."
17701667,"Chronic bronchitis was associated with a reduced risk of PROM ( RR 0.39 , 95 % CI 0.31 , 0.48 )."
17701667,"Asthma was significantly associated with PROM at preterm ( RR 1.15 , 95 % CI 1.14 , 1.17 ) and term ( RR 1.27 , 95 % CI 1.23 , 1.30 )."
17701667,"Stratification by race showed that acute upper respiratory disease was associated with preterm PROM in whites ( RR 1.90 , 95 % CI 1.71 , 2.11 ) and blacks ( RR 6.76 , 95 % CI 5.67 , 8.07 )."
17701667,Viral / bacterial pneumonia was associated with preterm PROM in blacks and term PROM in both races.
17701667,Asthma was associated with term PROM in blacks but not whites.
17701667,"Conclusions : Acute respiratory diseases and asthma during pregnancy are associated with spontaneous PROM , with substantially stronger association among blacks than whites."
17701667,"We speculate that timely diagnosis and treatment , coupled with closely mentoring of pregnant women may help reduce the rate of PROM and associated complications."
20440917,Background and aim : Millions of people suffer from chronic respiratory diseases ( CRD ).
20440917,To address this serious global health problem WHO formed the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases ( GARD ).
20440917,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a major priority of GARD due to high chronic morbidity and mortality ; however , there is still little prevalence data available."
20440917,"The prevalence of COPD in Georgia , as well as other CRD , is suspected to be high."
20440917,Methods : GARD Pilot Survey ( GAPS ) in Georgia had been carried out by the Georgian Respiratory Association.
20440917,The survey was conducted in the Sagarejo and Mtskheta districts with total population of about 70.000.
20440917,"All subjects provided information on asthma , bronchitis , respiratory symptoms , smoking , allergic conditions , CRD comorbidity and lifestyle via an interviewer - administered questionnaire."
20440917,"A total of 3,646 questionnaires were analysed."
20440917,"Results : It was discovered that official data concerning allergic rhinitis , TB and asthma are almost equal , but readings in relation to CRD are about five times lower according to official data of the Ministry of Health of Georgia."
20440917,The data results : for allergic rhinitis - 218 in GAPS vs. 177 in the official statistics ( for 100.000 population ) ; for TB -105 in GAPS vs. 147 in the official statistics ; for asthma -250 in GAPS vs. 374 in the official statistics ; the data about CRD according to our survey is almost five times higher - 365 in GAPS vs. 84 in the official statistics ( for 100.000 population ).
20440917,Conclusions : It is necessary to expand the survey to the entire country population.
20440917,"Country results are likely to be useful and interesting for local doctors and managers , as well as for officials."
25889673,"Background : There is increasing evidence that environmental factors such as air pollution from mine dumps , increase the risk of chronic respiratory symptoms and diseases."
25889673,The aim of this study was to investigate the association between proximity to mine dumps and prevalence of chronic respiratory disease in people aged 55 years and older.
25889673,"Methods : Elderly persons in communities 1 - 2 km ( exposed ) and 5 km ( unexposed ) , from five pre-selected mine dumps in Gauteng and North West Province , in South Africa were included in a cross-sectional study."
25889673,"Structured interviews were conducted with 2397 elderly people , using a previously validated ATS - DLD - 78 questionnaire from the British Medical Research Council."
25889673,"Results : Exposed elderly persons had a significantly higher prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms and diseases than those who were unexposed. , Results from the multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that living close to mine dumps was significantly associated with asthma ( OR = 1.57 ; 95 % CI : 1.20 - 2.05 ) , chronic bronchitis ( OR = 1.74 ; 95 CI : 1.25 - 2.39 ) , chronic cough ( OR = 2.02 ; 95 % CI : 1.58 - 2.57 ) , emphysema ( OR = 1.75 ; 95 % CI : 1.11 - 2.77 ) , pneumonia ( OR = 1.38 ; 95 % CI : 1.07 - 1.77 ) and wheeze ( OR = 2.01 ; 95 % CI : 1.73 - 2.54 )."
25889673,"Residing in exposed communities , current smoking , ex-smoking , use of paraffin as main residential cooking / heating fuel and low level of education emerged as independent significant risk factors for chronic respiratory symptoms and diseases."
16440404,"Objective : Although it has been suggested that depression is common in patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , few studies on the association between chronic respiratory diseases and depression have been conducted in the community."
16440404,"Method : Data from the baseline examination of two cohort studies , Mr and Ms Os , Hong Kong were used."
16440404,Three thousand nine hundred and ninety - eight Hong Kong men and women aged 65 to 92 were recruited.
16440404,"Depression was assessed by face - to - face interview , using the short - form of a validated Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS )."
16440404,"Chronic respiratory disease was assessed by subjects ' self reports of chronic respiratory disease ( chronic bronchitis , emphysema and asthma ) diagnosed by medical doctors."
16440404,"Adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for depression among subjects with chronic respiratory diseases relative to those without ( controls ) were calculated , after adjustments were made for potential confounders."
16440404,"Results : Chronic respiratory disease was associated with a higher prevalence of depressive disorders with an odds ratio of 1.58 ( 95 % CI = 1.12 - 2.13 ) after adjustment was made for age , sex , cigarette smoking , alcohol drinking and history of cardiovascular diseases when compared with controls."
16440404,"For those subjects with self report of chronic respiratory disease and who screened positive for depression ( n = 44 ) , none were on antidepressants."
16440404,"Among subjects who screened positive for depression without self - report of chronic respiratory disease ( n = 328 ) , only 2.74 % ( n = 9 ) were on antidepressants."
16440404,Conclusions : We conclude that chronic respiratory disease is independently associated with depression in Chinese elderly.
16440404,"Moreover , depression in the elderly is under - treated in those with and without chronic respiratory disease."
16440404,"Clinicians , especially primary care physicians in the community , should be more aware of increased prevalence of depression in patients with chronic respiratory disease."
25254605,Chronic respiratory diseases are complex multifactorial disorders whose pathogenesis depends on the interplay between host and environmental factors.
25254605,"To fully understand them and to identify novel treatments , a holistic approach that integrates multiple types and levels of clinical and biological data is necessary."
25254605,"Toward this end , the application of systems biology - based strategies , in particular , network analysis , offers great potential."
25254605,These systems - based approaches rely heavily on computational methods that can be challenging for the nonspecialist.
25254605,"Accordingly , this Pulmonary Perspective : ( 1 ) outlines the basic concepts of networks in biology and the fundamentals of network analysis , and ( 2 ) discusses recent applications of network analysis to understand respiratory diseases."
25254605,The intent of this Perspective is to provide readers with increased understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of network analysis methods as well as their usefulness in addressing research questions involving chronic respiratory diseases.
22975067,The discovery of ghrelin has resulted in the development of potential therapeutics for cachexia caused by multiple underlying diseases.
22975067,"When chronic respiratory diseases progress to their advanced stages , cachexia often occurs , thereby worsening the patient 's prognosis."
22975067,A small clinical trial that enrolled cachectic patients with chronic respiratory disease revealed that administration of ghrelin improved their nutritional status and exercise tolerance.
22975067,"Short - term administration of ghrelin was found to be safe and tolerated with adverse events , including suffusion , sleepiness , peristalsis , hunger , and sweating."
22975067,Further large - scale and long - term clinical trials are needed.
31939085,"Objectives : Chronic respiratory diseases ( CRD ) put patients at increased risk of respiratory infection and antimicrobial use , but surveillance results on community antimicrobial use are generally not adjusted for this risk factor."
31939085,"The objective of this study was to demonstrate the importance of accounting for CRD when interpreting indicators of community antimicrobial use in people over 65 years old , in Québec , Canada."
31939085,Methods : Retrospective cohort study of antimicrobial use according to CRD status in individuals over 65 years old covered by Québec 's public drug insurance plan between 2010 and 2015.
31939085,"Defined daily doses per 1000 person - days ( DID ) were computed per antimicrobial class and were further stratified according to chronic disease group , fiscal year , gender and age group."
31939085,Results : Antimicrobial use was 2.3 times higher in the CRD group ( 29.7 DID ) compared with the other chronic disease group ( 13.1 DID ) and 3.1 times higher than in the no chronic disease group ( 9.6 DID ).
31939085,"The same gradient was reflected as well in use per antimicrobial class , per age group , per gender , and in time."
31939085,Antimicrobial use increased throughout the study period and was higher in older age groups and in women.
31939085,Conclusions : Interpretation of results of antimicrobial use surveillance should consider the prevalence of CRD in populations.
31939085,"In order to identify opportunities for adapted interventions targeting inappropriate use , finer analyses are necessary."
25310950,"The level of illness acceptance correlates positively with compliance to the doctor 's recommendations , and negatively with the frequency and intensity of complications of chronic diseases."
25310950,"The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of the clinical condition on the level of illness acceptance , and to find variables which would have the most profound effect on the level of illness acceptance in patients with chronic respiratory diseases."
25310950,"The study group consisted of 594 adult patients ( mean age : 60 ± 15 years ) with mixed chronic respiratory diseases , recruited from patients of 136 general practitioners."
25310950,The average score in the Acceptance of Illness Scale was 26.2 ± 7.6.
25310950,The low level of illness acceptance was noted in 174 ( 62.6 % ) and high in 46 ( 16.6 % ) patients.
25310950,Analysis of multiple regressions was used to examine the influence of explanatory variables on the level of illness acceptance.
25310950,"The variables which shaped the level of illness acceptance in our patients included : improvement of health , intensity of symptoms , age , marital status , education level , place of residence , BMI , and the number of chronic diseases."
25310950,All above mentioned variables should be considered during a design of prevention programs for patients with mixed chronic respiratory diseases.
29025350,"The independent and central role of the patient with a complex chronic respiratory disease in targeted , personalized disease management strategies is becoming increasingly important."
29025350,Patients are the ones living with the disease and are finally responsible for their lives underlining their role as essential members of the interdisciplinary treatment team.
29025350,"Areas covered : The present paper narratively reviews existing research and discusses the special , as well as specialized , role of the patient with a complex chronic respiratory disease in the healthcare system and highlights fundamental elements of the ( future ) relationship between patient and healthcare professionals."
29025350,"Expert commentary : Since the chronic respiratory disease at hand is part of the patient 's entire life , we need holistic , personalized approaches optimizing patients ' quality of life by not only treating the disease but considering the patients ' whole environment and where healthcare professionals and patients are co-creating value care."
24380687,"Background : Corticosteroid - induced myopathy is a well known clinical entity , and experimental studies showed decreased rate of protein synthesis and increased rate of protein breakdown in muscles of chronically treated animals."
24380687,Objective : The present observational study was aimed to evaluate skeletal muscle functions in asthmatics and patients with other chronic respiratory diseases treated by inhaled or oral corticosteroids.
24380687,Methods : Thirty six patients with respiratory diseases were included into the study.
24380687,"The physician - rated peripheral motor deficits scale , stepper test and ankle / wrist index were used for assessment of muscle functions."
24380687,The effects of length of glucocorticoids intake on muscle functions were evaluated.
24380687,"Results : Sixty five per cent of patients using corticosteroids daily during 1 year and longer reported weakness in legs , and 20 % of these patients demonstrated objective signs of the muscle weakness."
24380687,"The performance on the stepper test was significantly worse in patients chronically using corticosteroids in comparison with the control group ( 10.9 ± 3.4 steps vs 16.1 ± 2.4 steps per 10s , respectively ; F = 21.6 , p < 0.001 )."
24380687,"In addition , a proportion of patients using corticosteroids for at least 18 months were characterized by muscle hypotrophy at a dominant leg."
24380687,Conclusion : Chronic intake of inhaled corticosteroids induces clinically significant decrease of muscle functions at least after 1 - year of daily treatment.
28340866,"Background : Clinical trials play a key role in advancing medical knowledge , improving patient care and promoting economic growth in Europe."
28340866,"We have assessed the clinical trial activity in any respiratory diseases in Europe , with a specific focus on Italy."
28340866,"Methods : Information from public sources ( EFPIA , clinicaltrials.gov , clinicaltrialsregister."
28340866,"eu , AIFA ) was used to describe clinical trial activity of in respiratory diseases in Europe and by country."
28340866,"Results : In 2015 , 3908 clinical trials were reported in Europe , 386 in respiratory diseases ( 9.9 % )."
28340866,"Germany was the first country both as absolute number ( 76 trials ) and as percentage within country trials ( 14 % ) , followed by Poland."
28340866,"Spain , Italy and France were the countries with the lowest number and percentage of trials in respiratory diseases."
28340866,No phase 1 or phase 4 trials were reported for respiratory trials.
28340866,Prevalence of respiratory trials by non-profit sponsors ( 28.3 % ) was below the average for the country ( 38.3 % ).
28340866,"Conclusions : Europe has a greater potential for clinical research on drugs for respiratory diseases , particularly in countries with less activity , such as Spain , France and Italy , that should identify and implement actions to increase attractiveness for clinical trials of drugs."
25123253,"Background and objective : The Clinical Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Questionnaire ( CCQ ) is an easy to complete , health - related quality of life questionnaire which has been well - validated in COPD."
25123253,The responsiveness of the CCQ in chronic respiratory disease patients other than COPD has not been previously described.
25123253,"The study aims were to determine if the CCQ in chronic respiratory disease correlates with other health related quality of life questionnaires , to assess the responsiveness of the CCQ to pulmonary rehabilitation and to determine the minimum important difference."
25123253,"Methods : The CCQ , COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) , the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire ( CRQ ) and St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) were measured in 138 chronic respiratory disease patients completing pulmonary rehabilitation."
25123253,Change in CCQ with pulmonary rehabilitation was correlated with change in the other questionnaires.
25123253,The minimum important difference of the CCQ was calculated using distribution and anchor - based approaches.
25123253,"Results : The CCQ , CAT , CRQ and SGRQ improved significantly with rehabilitation with effect sizes of -0.43 , -0.26 , 0.62 , -0.37."
25123253,"Change in CCQ correlated significantly with CAT , CRQ and SGRQ ( r = 0.53 , -0.64 , 0.30 , all P < 0.0001 )."
25123253,The minimum important difference was -0.42 at the population level and -0.4 at the individual level.
25123253,"Conclusions : The CCQ is responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic respiratory disease patients , with an MID estimated at -0.4 at the individual level."
27002668,Background : Patients with chronic neck pain show also respiratory dysfunctions.
27002668,Objective : To investigate the effects of respiratory muscle endurance training ( RMET ) on chronic neck pain.
27002668,"Methods : In this pilot study ( single - subject design : 3 baseline measurements , 4 measurements during RMET ) , 15 neck patients ( 49.3 ± 13.7 years ; 13 females ) conducted 20 sessions of home - based RMET using a SpiroTiger ® ( normocapnic hyperpnoea )."
27002668,"Maximal voluntary ventilation ( MVV ) , maximal inspiratory ( Pimax ) and expiratory ( Pemax ) pressure were measured before and after RMET."
27002668,"Neck flexor endurance , cervical and thoracic mobility , forward head posture , chest wall expansion and self - assessed neck disability [ Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) , Bournemouth questionnaire ] were weekly assessed."
27002668,Repeated measure ANOVA ( Bonferroni correction ) compared the first and last baseline and the last measurement after RMET.
27002668,"Results : RMET significantly increased MVV ( p = 0.025 ) , Pimax ( p = 0.001 ) and Pemax ( p < 0.001 )."
27002668,"During RMET , neck disability significantly decreased ( NDI : p = 0.001 ; Bournemouth questionnaire : p = 0.002 ) , while neck flexor endurance ( p < 0.001 ) and chest wall expansion ( p < 0.001 ) increased."
27002668,The changes in respiratory and musculoskeletal parameters did not correlate.
27002668,Conclusions : RMET emerged from this pilot study as a feasible and effective therapy for reducing disability in patients with chronic neck pain.
27002668,"The underlying mechanisms , including blood gas analyses , need further investigation in a randomized controlled study."
25292298,Haze is an atmospheric phenomenon in which dry particulate pollutants obscure the sky.
25292298,"Haze has been associated with chronic diseases , but its relationship with acute diseases is less clear."
25292298,"We aimed to determine the association between haze and acute cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , and respiratory diseases , in order to determine the influence of haze on human health."
25292298,"We compared the number of cases of acute cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , and respiratory diseases in Beijing Emergency Center between 2006 and 2013 , with haze data from Beijing Observatory."
25292298,The relationship between the number of hazy days and the number of cases of the above types of diseases was analyzed using univariate analyses.
25292298,Both the number of cases and the number of hazy days showed a rising trend.
25292298,The average number of cases per day for all three diseases was higher on hazy days than on non-hazy days.
25292298,"There was a positive correlation between the number of hazy days and the number of cases , and this correlation showed a hysteretic quality."
25292298,"Haze has an influence on acute cardiovascular ( CVDs ) , cerebrovascular ( CBDs ) , and respiratory system ( RSDs ) diseases."
25292298,"Haze seems to have an additive effect , since the associations between haze and number of cases were stronger in the following month than in the preceding month."
25292298,The increasing trend in the number of hazy days might worsen the problem of haze - related diseases.
27881264,"Objectives : Asia - Pacific Burden of Respiratory Diseases is a cross-sectional , observational study examining the burden of disease in adults with respiratory diseases across six countries."
27881264,"The aim of this study was to describe health care resource use ( HCRU ) , work impairment , cost burden , and health - related quality of life ( HRQOL ) associated with respiratory disease in the Asia - Pacific."
27881264,"Methods : Consecutive participants aged 18 years or older with a primary diagnosis of asthma , allergic rhinitis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , or rhinosinusitis were enrolled."
27881264,"Participants completed a survey detailing respiratory symptoms , HCRU , work productivity and activity impairment , and HRQOL."
27881264,Locally sourced unit costs for each country were used in the calculation of total costs.
27881264,Results : The study enrolled 5250 patients.
27881264,"Overall , the mean annual cost for patients with a respiratory disease was US $ 4191 ( SGD 8489 ) per patient."
27881264,"For patients who reported impairment at work , the mean annual cost was US $ 7315 ( SGD 10,244 ) , with productivity loss being the highest cost component for all four diseases ( US $ 6310 [ SGD 9100 ] )."
27881264,"On average , patients were impaired for one - third of their time at work and 5 % of their work time missed because of respiratory disease , which resulted in a 36 % reduction in productivity."
27881264,Patients with a primary diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had the greatest impact on HRQOL.
27881264,"Conclusions : In the Asia - Pacific , respiratory diseases have a significant impact on HCRU and associated costs , along with work productivity."
27881264,Timely and effective management of these diseases has the potential to reduce disease burden and health care costs and improve work productivity and HRQOL.
19187335,The aim of this pilot study was to add weight to a hypothesis according to which patients presenting with chronic neck pain could have a predisposition towards respiratory dysfunction.
19187335,Twelve patients with chronic neck pain and 12 matched controls participated in this study.
19187335,"Spirometric values , maximal static pressures , forward head posture and functional tests were examined in all subjects."
19187335,"According to the results , chronic neck patients presented with a statistically significant decreased maximal voluntary ventilation ( P = 0.042 ) and respiratory muscle strength ( Pimax and Pemax ) , ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.002 , respectively )."
19187335,"Furthermore , the current study demonstrated a strong association between an increased forward head posture and decreased respiratory muscle strength in neck pateits."
19187335,"The connection of neck pain and respiratory function could be an important consideration in relation to patient assessment , rehabilitation and consumption of pharmacological agents."
16626950,Rationale : Infradiagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) may be related to the lack of knowledge about the disease and / or the scarce use of diagnostic procedures.
16626950,"This study analyses the frequency of respiratory symptoms and the knowledge about COPD in the general population , together with the use of spirometry in individuals at risk of COPD."
16626950,"Population and method : A telephone survey was carried out in 6758 subjects older than 40 years , stratified by age , habitat ( urban or rural ) and region , screened by random - digit dialling."
16626950,Results : Up to 24 % reported having at least one chronic respiratory symptom and 20.9 % had a self - reported respiratory diagnosis.
16626950,A total of 19.2 % were active smokers and 40 % had never tried to quit.
16626950,"Only 60 % of the individuals with chronic symptoms had consulted a physician and , of them , only 45 % had undergone spirometry."
16626950,Spirometry was mentioned more frequently by subjects attended by pulmonologists than by GPs ( 67.6 vs. 28.6 % ; P < 0.001 ).
16626950,The term COPD was identified only by 8.6 % of the participants.
16626950,Conclusions : Many individuals with respiratory symptoms do not request medical attention and do not attempt to quit smoking.
16626950,There is a lack of knowledge about COPD.
16626950,Physicians should more actively inform about the disease and increase the use of spirometry for early detection.
17875577,"Background : The main influenza complications particularly affect patients over the age of 65 years and those with associated chronic diseases , such as respiratory disorders."
17875577,"This study aims to assess vaccination coverage among Spanish children and adults with chronic respiratory diseases ( CRDs ) , and to describe the factors associated with vaccination in 2003."
17875577,"Methods : We analysed 28,113 records of individuals ( 6869 children and 21,244 adults ) included in the Spanish National Health Survey ( NHS ) for 2003."
17875577,"As a dependent variable , we used the reply ( ' yes ' or ' no ' ) to the question : ' Did you have a ' flu shot in the latest campaign?"
17875577,' We calculated influenza vaccine coverage as the percentage of individuals with a respiratory disorder ( asthma and / or chronic bronchitis and / or emphysema ) who reported having been vaccinated against influenza in the most recent campaign.
17875577,"We analysed the influence of sociodemographic , health - status , medical visits and lifestyle variables on vaccination."
17875577,Results : Vaccination coverage was 19.9 % in children and 54.7 % in adults suffering CRD.
17875577,"In both age groups , coverages were significantly higher than those observed for non-CRD sufferers."
17875577,"Among adults , older age , not smoking and medical visits to their physician in the preceding 2 weeks were the variables independently and significantly associated with a higher likelihood of receiving the vaccine."
17875577,"Among children , financial factors influence vaccination."
17875577,Conclusions : Vaccination coverage among children with CRDs is very low.
17875577,"Also among adult CRD sufferers , vaccination remains below the desired level , thereby making it necessary for strategies to be implemented aimed at improving the use of influenza vaccine."
25087837,Objective : To evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive videogame ( IV ) system in addition to a supervised pulmonary rehabilitation programme ( PRP ) in patients with chronic respiratory diseases.
25087837,"Design : Randomised Controlled Trial comparing standard PRP ( 20 patients , control group : CG ) , and PRP + sessions of interactive videogame - aided exercises ( 20 patients , experimental group : EG )."
25087837,"Lung and respiratory muscle function , arterial blood gases , exercise capacity , dyspnoea , health status and health - related quality of life ( HRQL ) and emotional response were measured before and after PRP."
25087837,A questionnaire on acceptability of the PRP was administered.
25087837,"Results : Exercise capacity , dyspnoea and HRQL significantly improved in both groups after the PRP , whereas the EG showed a greater improvement in six - minute walk test and transitional dyspnoea index than the CG."
25087837,No difference in psychological status or acceptability of PRP was observed between the two groups.
25087837,"Conclusions : The addition of IV training was more effective for improving some parameters of exercise tolerance and dyspnoea , although did not result in better psychological status nor it was better accepted than the standard PRP in patients with chronic respiratory diseases."
33400932,"Eosinophils are bi-lobed , multi-functional innate immune cells with diverse cell surface receptors that regulate local immune and inflammatory responses."
33400932,Several inflammatory and infectious diseases are triggered with their build up in the blood and tissues.
33400932,The mobilization of eosinophils into the lungs is regulated by a cascade of processes guided by Th2 cytokine generating T - cells.
33400932,"Recruitment of eosinophils essentially leads to a characteristic immune response followed by airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling , which are hallmarks of chronic respiratory diseases."
33400932,"By analysing the dynamic interactions of eosinophils with their extracellular environment , which also involve signaling molecules and tissues , various therapies have been invented and developed to target respiratory diseases."
33400932,"Having entered clinical testing , several eosinophil targeting therapeutic agents have shown much promise and have further bridged the gap between theory and practice."
33400932,"Moreover , researchers now have a clearer understanding of the roles and mechanisms of eosinophils."
33400932,"These factors have successfully assisted molecular biologists to block specific pathways in the growth , migration and activation of eosinophils."
33400932,The primary purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the eosinophil biology with a special emphasis on potential pharmacotherapeutic targets.
33400932,"The review also summarizes promising eosinophil - targeting agents , along with their mechanisms and rationale for use , including those in developmental pipeline , in clinical trials , or approved for other respiratory disorders."
32252783,"Background : Chronic respiratory diseases constitute a considerable part in the practice of pulmonologists and primary care physicians ; spirometry is integral for the diagnosis and monitoring of these diseases , yet remains underutilized."
32252783,"The Air Next spirometer ( NuvoAir , Sweden ) is a novel ultra-portable device that performs spirometric measurements connected to a smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth ®."
32252783,Methods : The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy and validity of these measurements by comparing them with the ones obtained with a conventional desktop spirometer.
32252783,"Two hundred subjects were enrolled in the study with various spirometric patterns ( 50 patients with asthma , 50 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 50 with interstitial lung disease ) as well as 50 healthy individuals."
32252783,"Results : For the key spirometric parameters in the interpretation of spirometry , i.e. FEV1 , FVC , FEV1 / FVC and FEF25 - 75 % , Pearson correlation and Interclass Correlation Coefficient were greater than 0.94 , exhibiting perfect concordance between the two spirometers."
32252783,Similar results were observed in an exploratory analysis of the subgroups of patients.
32252783,"Using Bland - Altman plots we have shown good reproducibility in the measurements between the two devices , with small mean differences for the evaluated spirometric parameters and the majority of measurements being well within the limits of agreement."
32252783,Conclusions : Our results support the use of Air Next as a reliable spirometer for the screening and diagnosis of various spirometric patterns in clinical practice.
28093435,"Introduction : Asthma is one of the most frequently diagnosed respiratory diseases in the UK , and commonly co-occurs with other respiratory and allergic diseases , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and atopic dermatitis."
28093435,"Previous studies have shown an increased risk of lung cancer related to asthma , but the evidence is mixed when accounting for co-occurring respiratory diseases and allergic conditions."
28093435,"A systematic review of published data that investigate the relationship between asthma and lung cancer , accounting for co-occurring respiratory and allergic diseases , will be conducted to investigate the independent association of asthma with lung cancer."
28093435,"Methods and analysis : A systematic review will be conducted , and include original reports of cohort , cross-sectional and case - control studies of the association of asthma with lung cancer after accounting for co-occurring respiratory diseases."
28093435,"Articles published up to June 2016 will be included , and their selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines."
28093435,"A standardised data extraction form will be developed and pretested , and descriptive analyses will be used to summarise the available literature."
28093435,"If appropriate , pooled effect estimates of the association between asthma and lung cancer , given adjustment for a specific co-occurring condition will be estimated using random effects models."
28093435,Potential sources of heterogeneity and between study heterogeneity will also be investigated.
28093435,Ethics and dissemination : The study will be a review of published data and does not require ethical approval.
28093435,Results will be disseminated through a peer - reviewed publication.
28093435,Trial registration number : International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews ( PROSPERO ) number CRD42016043341.
30601674,"Background : Mounting evidence indicates that out - of - pocket costs for prescription medications , particularly among low - and middle - income patients with chronic diseases , are imposing financial burden , reducing medication adherence , and worsening health outcomes."
30601674,"This problem is exacerbated by a paucity of generic alternatives for prevalent lung diseases , such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , as well as high - cost medicines for rare diseases , such as cystic fibrosis."
30601674,"Affordability and access challenges are especially salient in the United States , as citizens of many other countries pay lower prices for and have greater access to prescription medications."
30601674,"Methods : The American Thoracic Society convened a multidisciplinary committee comprising experts in health policy pharmacoeconomics , behavioral sciences , and clinical care , along with individuals providing industry and patient perspectives."
30601674,"The report and its recommendation were iteratively developed over a year of in - person , telephonic , and electronic deliberation."
30601674,"Results : The committee unanimously recommended the establishment of a publicly funded , politically independent , impartial entity to systematically draft evidence - based pharmaceutical policy recommendations."
30601674,"The goal of this entity would be to generate evidence and action steps to ensure people have equitable and affordable access to prescription medications , to maximize the value of public and private pharmaceutical expenditures on health , to support novel drug development within a market - based economy , and to preserve clinician and patient choice regarding personalized treatment."
30601674,An immediate priority is to examine the evidence and make recommendations regarding the need to have essential medicines with established clinical benefit from each drug class in all Tier 1 formularies and propose recommendations to reduce barriers to timely generic drug availability.
30601674,"Conclusions : By making explicit , evidence - based recommendations , the entity can support the establishment of coherent national policies that expand access to affordable medications , improve the health of patients with chronic disease , and optimize the use of public and private resources."
19818795,Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are a group of proteases known to regulate the turnover of extracellular matrix and thus are suggested to be important in the process of several diseases associated with tissue remodeling.
19818795,"Furthermore , the concept that modulation of airway remodeling including excessive proteolysis damage of the tissue , may be of interest as a basis for future treatment."
19818795,Degradation of extracellular matrix is currently associated with structural and recruited cell activation and release of inflammatory mediators and MMPs.
19818795,"Indeed , a marked increase in their expression is observed associated with a variety of inflammatory diseases , including respiratory pathologies."
19818795,"In these conditions , we have to consider MMPs as therapeutic targets which can be inhibited by non-selective and / or selective inhibitors as anti-inflammatory compounds."
19818795,The present review aims to discuss the potential interest of the inhibition of MMP in inflammatory diseases with a focus on respiratory diseases.
24040892,Background : We examined the association of impaired lung function and respiratory symptoms with measures of health status and health - related quality of life ( HRQOL ) among US adults.
24040892,"Methods : The sample included 5139 participants aged 40 - 79 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 - 2010 who underwent spirometric testing and responded to questions about respiratory symptoms , health status , and number of physically unhealthy , mentally unhealthy , or activity limitation days in the prior 30 days."
24040892,"Results : Among these adults , 7.2 % had restrictive impairment ( FEV1 / FVC ≥ 70 % ; FVC < 80 % of predicted ) , 10.9 % had mild obstruction ( FEV1 / FVC < 70 % ; FEV1 ≥ 80 % predicted ) , and 9.0 % had moderate - severe obstruction ( FEV1 / FVC < 70 % ; FEV1 < 80 % predicted )."
24040892,"Individuals with restrictive impairment or moderate - severe obstruction were more likely to report fair / poor health compared to those with normal lung function ( prevalence ratio ( PR ) = 1.5 [ 95 % CI : 1.2 - 1.9 ] and 1.5 [ 1.3 - 1.8 ] ) , after controlling for sociodemographics , non-respiratory chronic diseases , body mass index , smoking , and respiratory symptoms."
24040892,"Frequent mental distress ( FMD ; ≥ 14 mentally unhealthy days ) , frequent physical distress ( FPD ; ≥ 14 physically unhealthy days ) , and frequent activity limitation ( FAL ; ≥ 14 activity limitation days ) did not differ by lung function status."
24040892,"Adults who reported any respiratory symptoms ( frequent cough , frequent phlegm , or past year wheeze ) were more likely to report fair / poor health ( PR = 1.5 [ 1.3 - 1.7 ] ) , FPD ( PR = 1.6 [ 1.4 - 1.9 ] ) , FMD ( PR = 1.8 [ 1.4 - 2.2 ] ) , and FAL ( PR = 1.4 [ 1.1 - 1.9 ] ) than those with no symptoms."
24040892,Conclusions : These results suggest the importance of chronic respiratory symptoms as potential risk factors for poor HRQOL and suggest improved symptom treatment and prevention efforts would likely improve HRQOL.
27155173,Chronic respiratory diseases ( CRDs ) affect hundreds of millions of people.
27155173,The United Nations 2011 meeting on non-communicable diseases ( NCDs ) marked a turning point in addressing this burden.
27155173,The targets established following this meeting incorporated specific measures to address the availability and affordability of essential medicines.
27155173,These are aligned with the sustainable development goals ( SDGs ) and the push for universal health coverage.
27155173,"However , essential medicines for CRDs remain unaffordable and unavailable to many."
27155173,"For asthma , the availability of medicines was respectively 30.1 % and 43.1 % in the public and private sectors."
27155173,"The maximum annual costs of treatment were US$ 102.10 for beclometasone , US$ 82.99 for salbutamol and US$ 1501.79 for budesonide , representing respectively 40 % , 15 % and 209 % of per capita income in Malawi , Burkina Faso and Guinea."
27155173,Multiple factors contribute to poor availability and affordability.
27155173,Experience from human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune - deficiency syndrome shows that medicines and care can be delivered in low - income countries and among the NCDs.
27155173,A unique example of an effective mechanism for providing access to affordable essential CRD medicines is the Asthma Drug Facility.
27155173,"Working on the six health system building blocks proposed by the World Health Organization can help countries address not only problems regarding access to medicines , but also those hampering adequate care."
27155173,"Improving medicine supply systems , training , national guidelines , financing , research , data utilisation and models of care at the primary health care level will help."
27155173,"A CRD target ( e.g. , 50 % reduction in asthma hospitalisations ) as well as the use of asthma as a measure for health system effectiveness and CRDs as a tracer for SDGs would help focus global , national and local leadership."
23258779,"While the acute respiratory risks of welding are well characterised , more chronic effects , including those on lung function , are less clear."
23258779,We carried out a systematic review of published longitudinal studies of lung function decline in welders.
23258779,Original cohort studies documenting two or more sequential measurements of lung function were reviewed.
23258779,Meta - analysis was carried out on studies with suitable data on forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV1 ).
23258779,"Seven studies were included ; their quality ( measured on the Newcastle - Ottawa scale ) was good , although exposure assessment was limited and the studies showed significant heterogeneity."
23258779,Five had data suitable for meta - analysis ; the pooled estimate of the difference in FEV1 decline between welders and nonwelders was -9.0 mL · year ( - 1 ) ( 95 % CI -22.5-4.5 ; p = 0.193 ).
23258779,The pooled estimates of difference in annual FEV1 decline between welders and referents who smoked was -13.7 mL · year ( - 1 ) ( 95 % CI -33.6-6.3 ; p = 0.179 ).
23258779,For welders and referents who did not smoke the estimated difference was -3.8 mL · year ( - 1 ) ( 95 % CI -20.2-12.6 ; p = 0.650 ).
23258779,Symptom prevalence data were mainly narrative ; smoking appeared to have the greatest effect on symptom evolution.
23258779,"Collectively , available longitudinal data on decline of lung function in welders and respiratory symptoms suggest a greater effect in those who smoke , supporting a focus on smoking cessation as well as control of fume exposure in this trade."
23258779,Further prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.
22835266,"Respiratory rehabilitation ( RR ) has been shown to be effective with a high level of evidence in terms of improving symptoms , exertion capacity and health - related quality of life ( HRQL ) in patients with COPD and in some patients with diseases other than COPD."
22835266,"According to international guidelines , RR is basically indicated in all patients with chronic respiratory symptoms , and the type of program offered depends on the symptoms themselves."
22835266,"As requested by the Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery ( SEPAR ) , we have created this document with the aim to unify the criteria for quality care in RR."
22835266,"The document is organized into sections : indications for RR , evaluation of candidates , program components , characteristics of RR programs and the role of the administration in the implementation of RR."
22835266,"In each section , we have distinguished 5 large disease groups : COPD , chronic respiratory diseases other than COPD with limiting dyspnea , hypersecretory diseases , neuromuscular diseases with respiratory symptoms and patients who are candidates for thoracic surgery for lung resection."
15530478,Background : The host inflammatory response and innate immunity play a complex role in respiratory diseases.
15530478,Methods : We evaluated the levels of inflammatory mediators and antibacterial proteins in children who required bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) for clinical indications such as chronic tracheostomy ( n = 15 ) and chronic suppurative lung disease ( n = 8 ).
15530478,Results : Our results suggested the presence of interleukin - 1beta ( IL - 1beta ) and IL - 8 as major inflammatory mediators in BALF samples.
15530478,The level of the antibacterial protein sIgA was higher than lactoferrin and lysozyme.
15530478,"BALF IL - 8 levels significantly correlated with the presence of IL - 1beta , IL - 6 , IL - 10 , IL - 16 , sIgA and lysozyme."
15530478,BALF IL - 8 levels did not correlate with the levels of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory clara cell 10 kDa protein ( CC10 ) or lactoferrin.
15530478,"Conclusion : This study suggests that patients with high levels of BALF IL - 8 could potentially have high levels of IL - 6 , IL - 10 , IL - 16 , lysozyme and sIgA."
15530478,Evaluating the inflammatory mediators ( IL - 8 ) in relation to other BALF protein components provides insight into understanding the role of inflammatory mediators in the regulation of host defense and the response to lung inflammation and injury.
8664961,Objectives : To investigate if the population living along streets with high traffic density has a higher prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms.
8664961,"Methods : A sample of 673 adults and 106 children ( 0 - 15 years ) , living along busy traffic streets in the city of Haarlem was compared with a control sample of 812 adults and 185 children living along quiet streets."
8664961,Exposed and control streets were selected on the basis of model calculations of NO2 concentrations.
8664961,A postal questionnaire containing questions about respiratory symptoms and several potential confounders was used to collect information from the study subjects.
8664961,"Results : After adjustment for potential confounders , children living along busy streets were found to have a higher prevalence of most respiratory symptoms than children living along quiet streets."
8664961,Adjusted odds ratios were significant for wheeze and for respiratory medication used.
8664961,"Risk ratios were higher for girls than for boys , with significant adjusted odds ratios between 2.9 and 15.8 for girls."
8664961,"In adults , only mild dyspnoea was more often reported by subjects living along streets with high traffic density."
8664961,Conclusions : The results suggest that living along busy streets increases the risk of developing chronic respiratory symptoms in children.
19390631,"Several chronic respiratory diseases exhibit hyperactive immune responses in the lung : abundant inflammatory mediators ; infiltrating neutrophils , macrophages , lymphocytes and other immune cells ; and increased level of proteases."
19390631,"Such diseases include cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and severe / neutrophilic asthma."
19390631,"Paradoxically , patients with these diseases are also susceptible to detrimental bacterial infection and colonization."
19390631,"In this paper , we seek to explain how a positive feedback mechanism via IL - 8 could lead to desensitization of epithelial cells to pathogen recognition thus perpetuating bacterial colonization and chronic disease states in the lung."
19390631,"Such insight was obtained from mathematical modeling of the IRAK / TRAF6 signaling module , and is consistent with existing clinical evidence."
19390631,The potential implications for targeted treatment regimes for these persistent respiratory diseases are explored.
20522851,"Background and aims : A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effect of arsenic ( As ) exposure from drinking water on respiratory symptoms using data from the Health Effects of Arsenic Exposure Longitudinal Study ( HEALS ) , a large prospective cohort study established in Ariahazar , Bangladesh in 2000 - 2002."
20522851,"A total of 7.31 , 9.95 and 2.03 % of the 11 746 participants completing 4 years of active follow - up reported having a chronic cough , breathing problem or blood in their sputum , respectively , as assessed by trained physicians."
20522851,"Methods : Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs for respiratory symptoms during the follow - up period in relation to levels of chronic As exposure assessed at baseline , adjusting for age , gender , smoking , body mass index , education and arsenic - related skin lesion status."
20522851,Results : Significant positive associations were found between As exposure and respiratory symptoms.
20522851,"As compared with those with the lowest quintile of water As level ( < or = 7 microg / l ) , the HRs for having respiratory symptoms were 1.27 ( 95 % CI 1.09 to 1.48 ) , 1.39 ( 95 % CI 1.19 to 1.63 ) , 1.43 ( 95 % CI 1.23 to 1.68 ) and 1.43 ( 95 % CI 1.22 to 1.68 ) for the second to fifth quintiles of baseline water As concentrations ( 7 - 40 , 40 - 90 , 90 - 178 and > 178 microg / l ) , respectively."
20522851,"Similarly , the corresponding HRs in relation to the second to fifth quintiles of urinary arsenic were 1.10 ( 95 % CI 0.94 to 1.27 ) , 1.11 ( 95 % CI 0.95 to 1.29 ) , 1.29 ( 95 % CI 1.11 to 1.49 ) and 1.35 ( 95 % CI 1.16 to 1.56 ) , respectively."
20522851,These associations did not differ appreciably by cigarette smoking status.
20522851,Conclusions : This prospective cohort study found a dose - response relationship between As exposure and clinical symptoms of respiratory diseases in Bangladesh.
20522851,"In particular , these adverse respiratory effects of As were clearly evident in the low to moderate dose range , suggesting that a large proportion of the country 's population may be at risk of developing serious lung diseases in the future."
10658547,Objective : To investigate short term effects of concentrations of pollutants in ambient air on hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in Hong Kong.
10658547,Methods : Retrospective ecological study.
10658547,A Poisson regression was performed of concentrations of daily air pollutant on daily counts of emergency hospital admissions in 12 major hospitals.
10658547,"The effects of time trend , season , and other cyclical factors , temperature , and humidity were accounted for."
10658547,Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected.
10658547,"Daily concentrations of nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) , ozone ( O3 ) , and particulate matter < 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter ( PM10 ) were obtained from seven air monitoring stations in Hong Kong in 1994 and 1995."
10658547,Relative risks ( RR ) of respiratory and cardiovascular disease admissions ( for an increase of 10 micrograms / m3 in concentration of air pollutant ) were calculated.
10658547,"Results : Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for all respiratory diseases , all cardiovascular diseases , chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases , and heart failure and the concentrations of all four pollutants."
10658547,"Admissions for asthma , pneumonia , and influenza were significantly associated with NO2 , O3 , and PM10."
10658547,"Relative risk ( RR ) for admissions for respiratory disease for the four pollutants ranged from 1.013 ( for SO2 ) to 1.022 ( for O3 ) , and for admissions for cardiovascular disease , from 1.006 ( for PM10 ) to 1.016 ( for SO2 )."
10658547,Those aged > or = 65 years were at higher risk.
10658547,"Significant positive interactions were detected between NO2 , O3 , and PM10 , and between O3 and winter months."
10658547,Conclusions : Adverse health effects are evident at current ambient concentrations of air pollutants.
10658547,"Further reduction in air pollution is necessary to protect the health of the community , especially that of the high risk group."
14534036,We investigated the prevalence of left - handedness among patients with different respiratory diseases.
14534036,Hand preference was assessed using the modified Edinburg Handedness Inventory.
14534036,There was a statistically significant decline in left - handedness with shortened life span in patients.
14534036,Difference among the rates of left - handedness in different pulmonary diseases was significant.
14534036,The rate of left - handedness was lowest in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( 2.14 % ) and pneumonia ( 2.04 % ) and highest in patients with asthma ( 12.96 % ).
14534036,The results suggest that left - handed subjects may be protected from certain pulmonary diseases while being more susceptible to others.
25924781,"Purpose : Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patients on long - term dialysis present changes in pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength , negatively influencing physical capacity."
25924781,Objective : To analyze the impact of a continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) protocol on the respiratory capacity of CKD patients under hemodialysis.
25924781,Methods : A randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 40 CKD patients 19 - 83 years old divided into two groups : control ( n = 20 ) and CPAP ( n = 20 ).
25924781,"Subjects were assessed on the respiratory muscle function test , maximal respiratory pressures , peak flow and 6 - min walk test , at baseline and again at the 2 - month follow - up."
25924781,"CPAP group patients were submitted to CPAP protocol ( PEEP : 5 cm H2O , flow : 15 L / min , FiO2 : 33 % ) three times per week during hemodialysis sessions."
25924781,"Results : The CPAP group showed higher forced vital capacity , forced expiratory volume in one second , peak expiratory flow , maximal inspiratory pressure , peak flow , as well as lower systolic blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate and Borg scale , in addition to a longer distance travelled on the 6 - min walk test , compared with the control group."
25924781,Conclusion : The introduction of a CPAP protocol during hemodialysis sessions had a positive impact on pulmonary function and physical capacity in CKD patients.
6524958,A 5 - yr prospective design was employed to test the hypothesis that exposure to diesel emissions leads to chronic respiratory effects among underground coal miners.
6524958,"Changes in respiratory function and development of chronic respiratory symptoms were measured during a 5 - yr study period ( i.e. , 1977 to 1982 ) in 280 diesel - exposed and 838 control miners from Eastern and Western United States underground coal mines."
6524958,"Spirometry measures of respiratory function included forced expiratory volume in 1 sec ( FEV1 .0 ) , forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , and forced expiratory flow rate at 50 % of FVC ( FEF50 )."
6524958,"Chronic respiratory symptom measures , which included chronic cough , chronic phlegm , and breathlessness , were obtained by questionnaires , as were smoking status and occupational history."
6524958,"Based upon these data , the pattern of evidence did not support the hypothesis either in an age - adjusted comparison of diesel vs. nondiesel miners or in an internal analysis by cumulative years of diesel exposure."
22266709,"Background : Many epidemiological studies have linked daily counts of hospital admissions to particulate matter ( PM ) with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm ( PM10 ) and ≤ 2.5 μm ( PM2 .5 ) , but relatively few have investigated the relationship of hospital admissions with coarse PM ( PMc ; 2.5 - 10 μm aerodynamic diameter )."
22266709,Objectives : We conducted this study to estimate the health effects of PMc on emergency hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Hong Kong after controlling for PM2 .5 and gaseous pollutants.
22266709,Methods : We conducted a time - series analysis of associations between daily emergency hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Hong Kong from January 2000 to December 2005 and daily PM2 .5 and PMc concentrations.
22266709,We estimated PMc concentrations by subtracting PM2 .5 from PM10 measurements.
22266709,"We used generalized additive models to examine the relationship between PMc ( single - and multiday lagged exposures ) and hospital admissions adjusted for time trends , weather conditions , influenza outbreaks , PM2 .5 , and gaseous pollutants ( nitrogen dioxide , sulfur dioxide , and ozone )."
22266709,"Results : A 10.9 - μg / m ( 3 ) ( interquartile range ) increase in the 4 - day moving average concentration of PMc was associated with a 1.94 % ( 95 % confidence interval : 1.24 % , 2.64 % ) increase in emergency hospital admissions for respiratory diseases that was attenuated but still significant after controlling for PM2 .5."
22266709,Adjusting for gaseous pollutants and altering models assumptions had little influence on PMc effect estimates.
22266709,Conclusion : PMc was associated with emergency hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Hong Kong independent of PM2 .5 and gaseous pollutants.
22266709,Further research is needed to evaluate health effects of different components of PMc.
24120308,"Chronic respiratory diseases often cause impairment in the functions and / or structure of the respiratory system , and impose limitations on different activities in the lives of persons who suffer them."
24120308,"In younger patients with an active working life , these limitations can cause problems in carrying out their normal work."
24120308,Article 41 of the Spanish Constitution states that « the public authorities shall maintain a public Social Security system for all citizens guaranteeing adequate social assistance and benefits in situations of hardship ».
24120308,"Within this framework is the assessment of fitness for work , as a dual - nature process ( medico - legal ) that aims to determine whether it is appropriate or not to recognise a person 's right to receive benefits which replace the income that they no longer receive as they can not carry out their work , due to loss of health."
24120308,"The role of the pulmonologist is essential in evaluating the diagnosis , treatment , prognosis and functional capacity of respiratory patients."
24120308,"These recommendations seek to bring the complex setting of fitness for work evaluation to pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons , providing action guidelines that allow them to advise their own patients about their incorporation into working life."
16973737,Objectives : To examine the exposure - response relationships between various indices of exposure to silica dust and the mortality from non-malignant respiratory diseases ( NMRDs ) or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases ( COPDs ) among a cohort of workers with silicosis in Hong Kong.
16973737,Methods : The concentrations of respirable silica dust were assigned to each industry and job task according to historical industrial hygiene measurements documented previously in Hong Kong.
16973737,Exposure indices included cumulative dust exposure ( CDE ) and mean dust concentration ( MDC ).
16973737,Penalised smoothing spline models were used as a preliminary step to detect outliers and guide further analyses.
16973737,Multiple Cox 's proportional hazard models were used to estimate the dust effects on the risk of mortality from NMRDs or COPDs after truncating the highest exposures.
16973737,"Results : 371 of the 853 ( 43.49 % ) deaths occurring among 2789 workers with silicosis during 1981 - 99 were from NMRDs , and 101 ( 27.22 % ) NMRDs were COPDs."
16973737,Multiple Cox 's proportional hazard models showed that CDE ( p = 0.009 ) and MDC ( p < 0.001 ) were significantly associated only with NMRD mortality.
16973737,Subgroup analysis showed that deaths from NMRDs ( p < 0.01 ) and COPDs ( p < 0.05 ) were significantly associated with both CDE and MDC among underground caisson workers and among those ever employed in other occupations with high exposure to silica dust.
16973737,No exposure - response relationship was observed for surface construction workers with low exposures.
16973737,A clear upward trend for both NMRDs and COPDs mortality was found with increasing severity of radiological silicosis.
16973737,"Conclusion : This study documented an exposure - response relationship between exposure to silica dust and the risk of death from NMRDs or COPDs among workers with silicosis , except for surface construction workers with low exposures."
16973737,"The risk of mortality from NMRDs increased significantly with the progression of International Labor Organization categories , independent of dust effects."
2596404,"In a soda ash plant , 58 workers exposed to mean airborne ammonia levels of 9.2 + / - 1.4 ppm were compared with 31 control workers with a mean exposure of 0.3 + / - 0.1 ppm."
2596404,"There were no differences between the groups in the reporting of respiratory or cutaneous symptoms , sense of smell , baseline lung function , or change in lung function over a work shift at the beginning and end of a workweek."
2596404,No relationships between level or length of ammonia exposure and lung function results were demonstrated.
3922504,"Many physicians believe that the hyperventilation syndrome is invariably associated with anxiety or undiagnosed organic disease such as asthma and pulmonary embolus , or both."
3922504,Twenty one patients referred by specialist physicians with unexplained somatic symptoms and unequivocal chronic hypocapnia ( resting end tidal Pco2 less than or equal to 4 kPa ( 30 mm Hg ) on repeated occasions during prolonged measurement ) were investigated.
3922504,All but one complained of inability to take a satisfying breath.
3922504,"Standard lung function test results and chest radiographs were normal in all patients , but histamine challenge showed bronchial hyper - reactivity in two of 20 patients tested , and skin tests to common allergens were positive in three of 18."
3922504,"Ventilation - perfusion scanning was abnormal in a further three of 15 patients studied , with unmatched perfusion defects in two and isolated ventilation defects in one."
3922504,"None of the 21 had thyrotoxicosis , severe coronary heart disease , or other relevant cardiovascular abnormalities."
3922504,"Ten of the 21 patients were neurotic and suffered from chronic psychiatric disturbance characterised by anxiety , panic , and phobic symptoms."
3922504,The remainder had no detectable psychiatric disorders but reported proportionately more somatic than anxiety symptoms.
3922504,Severe hyperventilation can occur in the absence of formal psychiatric or detectable respiratory or other organic abnormalities.
3922504,Asthma and pulmonary embolus must be specifically excluded.
33546658,Background : Comorbidities play a key role in severe disease outcomes in COVID - 19 patients.
33546658,"However , the literature on preexisting respiratory diseases and COVID - 19 , accounting for other possible confounders , is limited."
33546658,The primary objective of this study was to determine the association between preexisting respiratory diseases and severe disease outcomes among COVID - 19 patients.
33546658,Secondary aim was to investigate any correlation between smoking and clinical outcomes in COVID - 19 patients.
33546658,"Methods : This is a multihospital retrospective cohort study on 1871 adult patients between March 10 , 2020 , and June 30 , 2020 , with laboratory confirmed COVID - 19 diagnosis."
33546658,"The main outcomes of the study were severe disease outcomes i.e. mortality , need for mechanical ventilation , and intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission."
33546658,"During statistical analysis , possible confounders such as age , sex , race , BMI , and comorbidities including , hypertension , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , diabetes , any history of cancer and prior liver disease , chronic kidney disease , end - stage renal disease on dialysis , hyperlipidemia and history of prior stroke , were accounted for."
33546658,"Results : A total of 1871 patients ( mean ( SD ) age , 64.11 ( 16 ) years ; 965 ( 51.6 % ) males ; 1494 ( 79.9 % ) African Americans ; 809 ( 43.2 % ) with ≥ 3 comorbidities ) were included in the study."
33546658,"During their stay at the hospital , 613 patients ( 32.8 % ) died , 489 ( 26.1 % ) needed mechanical ventilation , and 592 ( 31.6 % ) required ICU admission."
33546658,"In fully adjusted models , patients with preexisting respiratory diseases had significantly higher mortality ( adjusted Odds ratio ( aOR ) , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 1.08 - 1.72 ; p = 0.01 ) , higher rate of ICU admission ( aOR , 1.34 ; 95 % CI , 1.07 - 1.68 ; p = 0.009 ) and increased need for mechanical ventilation ( aOR , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 1.07 - 1.72 ; p = 0.01 )."
33546658,"Additionally , patients with a history of smoking had significantly higher need for ICU admission ( aOR , 1.25 ; 95 % CI , 1.01 - 1.55 ; p = 0.03 ) in fully adjusted models."
33546658,"Conclusion : Preexisting respiratory diseases are an important predictor for mortality and severe disease outcomes , in COVID - 19 patients."
33546658,These results can help facilitate efficient resource allocation for critical care services.
6228174,Using the weighted spirometer technique we studied chest wall compliance ( Cw ) in 16 nonobese patients with chronic weakness of the respiratory muscles and 20 healthy control subjects.
6228174,"In order to evaluate the validity of the technique , while Cw was being measured , we monitored thoracoabdominal configuration with 2 pairs of linearized magnetometers and electrical activity of the external oblique with a concentric needle electrode in 3 healthy subjects and 4 patients ; in addition , we recorded in 3 subjects the electrical activity from the intercostal muscles and diaphragm throughout the procedure."
6228174,The method was reproducible within 5.8 % and provided Cw values that compared well with those yielded by the relaxation technique.
6228174,"In each subject , the weight - induced shifts in end - expiratory lung volume showed a very good linear correlation with the changes in transrespiratory pressure at end - expiration ( r greater than or equal to 0.91 )."
6228174,"In addition , in none of the subjects tested did the electromyograms reveal any intercostal , diaphragmatic , or abdominal muscle activity at end - expiration , nor did the end - expiratory level ever show a significant departure from the relaxed thoracoabdominal configuration , thus suggesting adequate respiratory muscle relaxation."
6228174,"The reduction in inspiratory muscle force in the patients ranged from 17 to 94 % of predicted ( mean + / - SE , 43 + / - 6 )."
6228174,"The decrease in vital capacity , total lung capacity , and functional residual capacity averaged 59 , 34 , and 15 % of predicted , respectively."
6228174,Both the patient and the control groups showed a large interindividual variability regarding Cw.
6228174,"It varied from 0.117 to 0.258 L / cm H2O ( mean + / - SE , 0.162 + / - 0.012 ) in the patients and from 0.163 to 0.366 L / cm H2O ( mean + / - SE , 0.248 + / - 0.013 ) in the healthy subjects."
6228174,( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
12598398,"We describe two children with oxygen dependence , which resolved when congenital adrenal hypoplasia was diagnosed and treatment initiated."
12598398,Chronic respiratory distress can be a symptom of adrenal hypoplasia and this should be taken into consideration when investigating a child with unexplained chronic respiratory difficulties.
12598398,Respiratory symptoms resolve very quickly when the underlying condition is recognised and treated.
8175578,Sulfur mustard ( SM ) has been used as a vesicant chemical warfare agent.
8175578,"To investigate the respiratory damages it causes , we studied the effects on guinea pigs of an intratracheal injection of 0.3 mg / kg of SM 5 h and 14 days after injection."
8175578,"Five hours after SM intoxication , respiratory system resistance and microvascular permeability were increased."
8175578,These alterations were not prevented by pretreatment with 50 mg / kg sc of capsaicin 2 wk before SM intoxication.
8175578,"Histological studies showed columnar cell shedding all along the tracheal epithelium , bronchoconstriction , and peribronchial edema."
8175578,"Fourteen days after SM intoxication , guinea pigs demonstrated airway hyperreactivity to aerosolized substance P and histamine."
8175578,Pretreatment with phosphoramidon caused a further increase in airway responsiveness to substance P. Neutral endopeptidase activity in the tracheal epithelium was decreased by twofold in SM - intoxicated guinea pigs.
8175578,"At this stage , the tracheal epithelium was disorganized and atrophic."
8175578,"These results demonstrate that in guinea pigs SM intoxication induces severe lesions to the tracheal epithelium , which might account for the airway hyperresponsiveness observed 14 days after intoxication."
10378399,Neonatal chronic lung disease ( CLD ) is usually diagnosed if an infant remains oxygen dependent beyond 36 weeks postconceptional age ( PCA ).
10378399,Our aim was to determine whether a shorter duration of respiratory support accurately predicted subsequent respiratory morbidity.
10378399,"A total of 103 infants , median gestational age 29 weeks ( range 23 - 35 ) , were followed prospectively for 5 years."
10378399,"They had a birth weight of < 1500 g or , if a birth weight of between 1500 and 2000 g , had required neonatal ventilatory support."
10378399,"Parents completed diary cards ; their child had positive symptom status if , in any one year , they coughed and / or wheezed on at least 3 days per week for a 4 - week period or for at least 3 days following each upper respiratory tract infection."
10378399,"Subsequent respiratory morbidity , positive symptom status in years 1 and 2 or all 5 pre-school years , was related to various definitions of prolonged respiratory support : intermittent positive pressure ventilation dependence > 7 days ; oxygen dependence > 28 days and oxygen dependence > 36 weeks PCA."
10378399,"In years 1 and 2 , 25 children were symptomatic and 22 in all 5 years."
10378399,The patients with subsequent respiratory morbidity were distinguished from those without by requiring longer respiratory support ( P < 0.05 ).
10378399,Logistic regression analysis demonstrated only oxygen dependence beyond 28 days was independently related to subsequent respiratory morbidity ( P < 0.01 ).
10378399,"The positive predictive values and likelihood ratios ( 95 % confidence intervals ) for positive symptom status in all 5 years were for intermittent positive pressure ventilation > 7 days 35 % ( 16 - 53 ) and 19.5 ( 1.01 - 3.76 ) , for oxygen dependency > 28 days 42 % ( 23 - 61 ) and 2.20 ( 1.45 - 5.02 ) and for oxygen dependency > 36 weeks PCA 35 % ( 13 - 58 ) and 1.67 ( 0.65 - 4.31 )."
10378399,"Conclusion : Oxygen dependency at 28 days of age remains a useful criterion on which to diagnose "" neonatal "" chronic lung disease."
18001951,"In patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , oscillatory breathing pattern predicts poor prognosis."
18001951,"This work proposes a method to identify the respiratory pattern to determine periodic breathing ( PB ) , Cheyne - Stokes respiration ( CSR ) and non-periodic respiratory patterns ( nPB ) through the respiratory flow signal."
18001951,"26 patients are studied , classified in G ( 1 ) ( PB ) , G ( 2 ) ( CSR ) and G ( 3 ) ( nPB )."
18001951,"The flow signal is filtered and normalized , to obtain the positive envelope that describes the respiratory pattern."
18001951,With this new signal some features are extracted through its power spectral density ( PSD ).
18001951,An adaptive feature selection algorithm is applied before the linear and non linear classification applying Leave - one - out cross-validation technique.
18001951,"The result obtained with linear classification was 93 % using the relation between total energy and frequency interval ( I ( 1 ) ) , peak amplitude ( ampp ) , peak frequency ( fp ) , and the highest slope of the positive envelope 's PSD ( Slope ( max ) )."
18001951,"And the best result was obtained with non linear technique , with 100 % correctly classified patients , using only two parameters , fp and Slope ( max )."
2048837,Disagreement exists on how to define asthma in population studies.
2048837,Features characteristic of asthma also have been demonstrated in nonasthmatic subjects.
2048837,"For example , although in a random sample of 339 subjects investigated in the Netherlands , subjects with a history of asthmatic attacks , wheeze and / or dyspnea , or chronic dry cough on average were the most responsive ( mean PD20 values for histamine of 11.5 , 17.0 , and 15.0 mg / ml ) and asymptomatic subjects were the least responsive ( mean PD20 , 45.4 mg / ml ) , the distributions of PD20 values in all groups overlapped considerably."
2048837,The best way to investigate the association between exposure and disease is in a cohort study.
2048837,It is argued that follow - up studies in patients may have limited meaning because of a high risk for selection bias.
2048837,"Furthermore , in general , diagnostic disease entities will not represent homogeneous exposure groups."
2048837,"It is concluded that end points of disease should be defined as objectively as possible , for instance , as the level of FEV1 , or as simple respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea , wheeze , or chronic cough."
2048837,"Terms such as "" asthma , "" "" COPD , "" or "" CNSLD "" will not be helpful in defining end points because there is a risk that they could introduce bias , misclassification , and hence confusion."
19209529,Background : Oxygen uptake efficiency slope ( OUES ) is proposed as an objective index of cardiorespiratory functional reserve.
19209529,The AIM of the present study was to evaluate the effect of coexisting respiratory diseases on OUES in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) ( New York Heart Association class II - III ) during incremental exercise testing.
19209529,Patients and methods : Fifty - five males were allocated to three groups : group 1 - 19 patients with only CHF ( CHF ) ; group 2 - 17 patients with CHF and a history of respiratory disease ( CHF - RD ) ; group 3 - 19 matched controls ( C ).
19209529,They all underwent comprehensive lung function testing and symptom - limited ramp cardiopulmonary exercise test on a cycle ergometer.
19209529,"Results : The patients with a history of respiratory diseases had the lowest value of OUES , but their results were not significantly different from those of the CHF patients ( OUES mL.min ( - 1 )."
19209529,logL ( - 1 ) = 1461 + / - 268 vs. 1571 + / - 383 vs. 2112 + / - 263 in controls ).
19209529,"Significant correlation was found between OUES and important functional variables : VO2peak ( r = 0.833 ) , V ( E ) / NCO2 slope ( r = -0.757 ) , FEV1 ( r = 0.582 ) , T ( L , CO ) ( r = 0.574 ) , and EF % ( r = 0.350 )."
19209529,Conclusions : OUES is significantly reduced in patients with CHF and tends to be lower in the presence of a respiratory disease.
19209529,"It can be regarded as an useful , reliable physiologic marker of reduced ventilatory efficiency and cardiorespiratory reserve in chronic heart failure."
1443150,"The effects of aging , tachypnea , bolus volume , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on the coordination of swallowing with the phases of respiration were studied by concurrent respirography and submental surface electromyography."
1443150,"Study findings showed that in young healthy volunteers , during rest , there is preferential coupling of subconscious swallowing with the expiratory phase of continuous respiration."
1443150,This preferential coupling of swallowing with expiration was found to increase relative to other phases of respiration during water swallows and tachypnea ( P < 0.05 ).
1443150,Respiratory phase occurrence of swallowing and postdeglutitive resumption of respiration during exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was found to be significantly different compared with the basal state ( P < 0.05 ).
1443150,Respiratory phase occurrence of subconscious swallowing in the elderly was found to be different from the young ( P < 0.05 ).
1443150,Position had no significant effect on the coordination of swallowing and phases of respiration.
1443150,We concluded that in resting young volunteers the majority of deglutitions are coupled with the expiratory phase of swallowing.
1443150,This coupling is increased in frequency by the presence of a liquid bolus and tachypnea.
1443150,"And finally , age and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alter this coordination significantly."
2317086,"Fifty - two males and 1 female , who were 19 to 62 y of age ( median = 26 ) , were employed at an eastern Quebec peat moss plant and were included in this study."
2317086,"Of these 53 workers , 29 were smokers , 5 were ex-smokers , and 19 had never smoked."
2317086,The workers were divided by level of exposure into 4 groups : ( 1 ) group 1 -- minimal exposure ( N = 7 ) ; ( 2 ) group 2 -- light exposure ( N = 7 ) ; ( 3 ) group 3 -- moderate exposure ( N = 17 ) ; and ( 4 ) group 4 -- heavy exposure ( N = 22 ).
2317086,Chest radiographs and physical examinations were normal for all subjects.
2317086,Only 1 subject had precipitins to Penicillium and Monocillium species isolated from the peat moss plant.
2317086,Pulmonary function tests were normal and similar in all groups.
2317086,"Thirty - three subjects ( 20 smokers , 4 ex-smokers , and 9 nonsmokers ) had chronic bronchitis ; these symptoms were related to work exposure for 28 subjects."
2317086,Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was measured in 14 subjects who had persistent cough and sputum.
2317086,"No subject had evidence of airway hyper - responsiveness , i.e. , PC20 metacholine less than 8 mg / ml."
2317086,"We concluded that the peat moss workers in our study showed no evidence of extrinsic allergic alveolitis ; however , chronic exposure to organic dust leads to chronic cough and sputum production , which is not associated with significant lung impairment nor increase in nonspecific airway responsiveness."
6333193,A 67 - yr - old man presented with a 4 - yr history of chronic ventilatory failure in the absence of any restrictive or obstructive ventilatory defect.
6333193,"Detailed neurologic investigations were unremarkable , and the response of minute volume of ventilation to inhaled CO2 was normal."
6333193,"During sleep there was no evidence of upper airway obstruction , and minute volume of ventilation averaged 6.7 L / min , compared with 7.2 L / min during quiet wakefulness."
6333193,"However , sleep was associated with a rapid and shallow pattern of breathing , resulting in high dead space ventilation , inadequate alveolar ventilation , hypoxemia , and hypercapnia."
6333193,Correction of the abnormal ventilatory pattern during sleep by diaphragmatic pacing abolished all features of chronic respiratory failure.
6333193,"The findings indicate that a disorder of respiratory pattern during sleep can produce chronic ventilatory failure , despite normal respiratory drive."
16411026,Background : Optimizing the validity and responsiveness of utility measures will enhance their usefulness in randomized trials.
16411026,We evaluated the impact of clinical marker state ( CMS ) rating prior to patients ' rating their own health on two utility instruments ( feeling thermometer ( FT ) and standard gamble ( SG ) ) in patients with chronic respiratory disease ( CRD ).
16411026,"Methods : We randomized 182 patients with CRD to complete the FT ( self - administered ) and SG with CMS ( FT + / SG + , n = 91 ) or without marker states ( FT - / SG - , n = 91 ) before and after undergoing respiratory rehabilitation in a multi-center trial."
16411026,Results : Use of CMS did not influence baseline utility scores.
16411026,"Improvement after therapy on the scale from 0 ( dead ) to 1.0 ( full health ) was 0.04 both in FT + ( p = 0.03 ) and FT - ( p = 0.02 ; the difference between FT + and FT - was 0.00 , p = 0.83 )."
16411026,"Improvement on the SG was 0.05 in both SG + ( p = 0.08 ) and SG - ( p = 0.04 ; difference between SG + and SG - 0.00 , p = 0.95 )."
16411026,Correlations with other health related quality of life scores were highest for FT +.
16411026,Conclusion : Administration of CMS did not improve responsiveness of the FT but may have improved construct validity.
16411026,The SG showed limited construct validity and responsiveness that was not influenced by CMS use.
31092319,Background : Physical activity measures are valuable for assessing the progression of chronic respiratory diseases.
31092319,The 4 - m gait speed ( 4MGS ) test is an established functional assessment in the elderly.
31092319,"However , the relationship between the 4MGS and daily activity in patients with chronic respiratory diseases has not been fully understood."
31092319,"The present study aimed to investigate whether the 4MGS predicted daily activity , including physical activity level ( PAL ) , in patients with chronic respiratory diseases."
31092319,"Methods : We enrolled 57 patients with chronic respiratory diseases , including interstitial lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and evaluated the correlations between the 4MGS and various clinical parameters , including respiratory function , the 6 - min walk test ( 6MWT ) , and daily activities , by using an accelerometer."
31092319,Linear regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors of daily activity.
31092319,"Results : The 4MGS was significantly correlated with daily step counts and PAL , as well as the 6 min walk distance ( r = 0.477 , p < 0.001 ; r = 0.433 , p = 0.001 ; and r = 0.593 , p < 0.001 , respectively )."
31092319,"In the multivariate linear regression analysis , the 4MGS , % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s , and body mass index were independent predictors of PAL."
31092319,"Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that a 4MGS < 1.07 m / s was the optimal cutoff for predicting an inactive PAL ( area under the curve , 0.728 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.589 - 0.866 )."
31092319,"Patients with a slower 4MGS had significantly reduced daily activity than did those with a preserved 4MGS , despite similar modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale measures and respiratory parameters , such as oxygenation profiles."
31092319,Conclusions : The 4MGS test is a simple screening test and a useful predictor of worsening daily activity in patients with chronic respiratory diseases.
30079789,Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy is a minimally invasive procedure performed for those who require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
30079789,It is a procedure that is performed routinely at the bedside in the intensive care unit.
30079789,"Complications nonetheless still occur , and as a result , several technique modifications have been employed."
30079789,"At Loma Linda University Medical Center , we have implemented a novel technique using augmented reality during percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy placement in an attempt to minimize such complications."
30079789,"Using Brother 's AiRScouter WD - 200B head mounted display , the tracheostomy operator is able to focus on the surgical field without having to significantly break line of sight to view the traditional bronchoscopy monitor."
30079789,Six cases have been treated with this procedure to date with good success and excellent user feedback.
30079789,We aim to assess augmented reality - assisted percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy and determine its overall efficacy when compared to traditional percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy.
24998026,"Background : The prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases ( CRDs ) , including chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , has increased significantly over the past decades."
24998026,"Several studies suggest that Helicobacter pylori infection may be related to the development of CRDs , but the results were not consistent."
24998026,We carried out a meta - analysis to evaluate the potential association of H.pylori infection with CRDs.
24998026,"Methods : We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed , Embase , Ovid , Google Scholar and CNKI from inception to October 31 , 2013."
24998026,"The following search terms were used : "" chronic respiratory disease , "" "" chronic bronchitis , "" "" chronic obstructive pulmonary disease "" or "" COPD "" in combination with "" Helicobacter pylori "" or "" Campylobacter pylori ."""
24998026,"According to established inclusion criteria , we selected all eligible published papers and then extracted essential data."
24998026,"To evaluate the association of H.pylori with chronic bronchitis and COPD , an overall analysis and subgroup analyses were conducted."
24998026,Results : A total of 9 case - control studies comprising 782 cases and 815 controls were included in the study.
24998026,"Pooled ORs were 2.30 ( 95 % CI : 1.85 - 2.85 ) in the overall analysis , 2.90 ( 95 % CI : 2.04 - 4.13 ) in the chronic bronchitis subgroup , and 2.11 ( 95 % CI : 1.35 - 3.29 ) in the COPD subgroup."
24998026,Conclusions : The results of the overall analysis and subgroup analyzed suggest a significant association between H.pylori and CRDs.
24998026,Further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenetic mechanisms involved.
32102596,Background.
32102596,Intermittent hypoxia can induce respiratory neuroplasticity to enhance respiratory motor outputs following hypoxic treatment.
32102596,This type of respiratory neuroplasticity is primarily mediated by the activation of Gq - protein - coupled 5 - HT2 receptors and constrained by Gs - protein - coupled 5 - HT7 receptors.
32102596,Objective.
32102596,The present study hypothesized that the blockade of 5 - HT7 receptors can potentiate the effect of intermittent hypercapnic - hypoxia on respiratory function after cervical spinal cord contusion injury.
32102596,Methods.
32102596,"The ventilatory behaviors of unanesthetized rats with midcervical spinal cord contusions were measured before , during , and after daily acute intermittent hypercapnic - hypoxia ( 10 episodes of 5 minutes of hypoxia [ 10 % O2 , 4 % CO2 , 86 % N2 ] with 5 minutes of normoxia intervals for 5 days ) at 8 weeks postinjury."
32102596,"On a daily basis , 5 minutes before intermittent hypercapnic - hypoxia , rats received either a 5 - HT7 receptor antagonist ( SB269970 , 4 mg / kg , intraperitoneal ) or a vehicle ( dimethyl sulfoxide )."
32102596,Results.
32102596,Treatment with intermittent hypercapnic - hypoxia induced a similar increase in tidal volume between rats that received SB269970 and those that received dimethyl sulfoxide within 60 minutes post-hypoxia on the first day.
32102596,"However , after 2 to 3 days of daily acute intermittent hypercapnic - hypoxia , the baseline tidal volumes of rats treated with SB269970 increased significantly."
32102596,Conclusions.
32102596,These results suggest that inhibiting the 5 - HT7 receptor can transiently improve daily intermittent hypercapnic - hypoxia - induced tidal volume increase in midcervical spinal contused animals.
32102596,"Therefore , combining pharmacological treatment with rehabilitative intermittent hypercapnic - hypoxia training may be an effective strategy for synergistically enhancing respiratory neuroplasticity to improve respiratory function following chronic cervical spinal cord injury."
26805870,"It is common for elderly people and those with such chronic disorders as respiratory diseases to suffer severe complications from influenza , a viral infection."
26805870,The voluntary uptake of vaccination is vital to the effectiveness of influenza prevention efforts.
26805870,The Health Belief Model ( HBM ) is the most commonly used framework in the field of vaccination behavior to explain the decision that people make to accept or refuse vaccination.
26805870,"In addition , psychological flexibility is considered helpful in causing people to be open to adopting new practices that are consistent with their values."
26805870,This study examined the role of psychological flexibility and health beliefs in predicting the uptake of influenza vaccination among people in Hong Kong.
26805870,Eligible participants were Hong Kong permanent residents aged 18 years or above with a history of chronic respiratory diseases ( CRD ).
26805870,A convenience sample of 255 patients was recruited to participate in a cross-sectional survey in which HBM components and factors of psychological flexibility were assessed.
26805870,"The following variables were found to be significant predictors of vaccination : age , smoking status , comorbidity , previous hospitalization , perceived susceptibility , perceived severity , and psychological flexibility."
26805870,Enhancing psychological flexibility might be a potential new direction for motivating people to accept influenza vaccination.
25541376,Background : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a frequent comorbidity in patients with heart failure ( HF ).
25541376,Elevated pulmonary arterial ( PA ) pressure can be seen in both conditions and has been shown to predict morbidity and mortality.
25541376,Methods and results : A total of 550 subjects with New York Heart Association functional class III HF were randomly assigned to the treatment ( n = 270 ) and control ( n = 280 ) groups in the CHAMPION Trial.
25541376,"Physicians had access to the PA pressure measurements in the treatment group only , in which HF therapy was used to lower the elevated pressures."
25541376,HF and respiratory hospitalizations were compared in both groups.
25541376,A total of 187 subjects met criteria for classification into the COPD subgroup.
25541376,"In the entire cohort , the treatment group had a 37 % reduction in HF hospitalization rates ( P < .0001 ) and a 49 % reduction in respiratory hospitalization rates ( P = .0061 )."
25541376,"In the COPD subgroup , the treatment group had a 41 % reduction in HF hospitalization rates ( P = .0009 ) and a 62 % reduction in respiratory hospitalization rates ( P = .0023 )."
25541376,The rate of respiratory hospitalizations in subjects without COPD was not statistically different ( P = .76 ).
25541376,Conclusions : HF management incorporating hemodynamic information from an implantable PA pressure monitor significantly reduces HF and respiratory hospitalizations in HF subjects with comorbid COPD compared with standard care.
24057999,Background : Exhaled carbon monoxide ( COex ) level is positively associated with tobacco smoking and exposure to smoke from biomass / coal burning.
24057999,Relatively little is known about its determinants in China despite the population having a high prevalence of smoking and use of biomass / coal.
24057999,"Methods : The China Kadoorie Biobank includes 512,000 participants aged 30 - 79 years recruited from 10 diverse regions."
24057999,"We used linear regression and logistic regression methods to assess the associations of COex level with smoking , exposures to indoor household air pollution and prevalent chronic respiratory conditions among never smokers , both overall and by seasons , regions and smoking status."
24057999,Results : The overall COex level ( ppm ) was much higher in current smokers than in never smokers ( men : 11.5 vs 3.7 ; women : 9.3 vs 3.2 ).
24057999,"Among current smokers , it was higher among those who smoked more and inhaled more deeply."
24057999,"Among never smokers , mean COex was positively associated with levels of exposures to passive smoking and to biomass / coal burning , especially in rural areas and during winter."
24057999,"The odds ratios ( OR ) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) of air flow obstruction ( FEV1 / FVC ratio < 0.7 ) for never smokers with COex at 7 - 14 and ≥ 14 ppm , compared with those having COex < 7 , were 1.38 ( 1.31 - 1.45 ) and 1.65 ( 1.52 - 1.80 ) , respectively ( Ptrend < 0.001 )."
24057999,Prevalence of other self - reported chronic respiratory conditions was also higher among people with elevated COex ( P < 0.05 ).
24057999,"Conclusion : In adult Chinese , COex can be used as a biomarker for assessing current smoking and overall exposure to indoor household air pollution in combination with questionnaires."
17905823,Background : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is an insidiously starting disease.
17905823,Early detection has high priority because of the possibility of early implementation of smoking cessation interventions.
17905823,An evidence based model for case finding of COPD is not yet available.
17905823,"Objective : To describe the early development of COPD , and to assess the predictive value of early signs ( respiratory symptoms , lung function below the normal range , reversibility )."
17905823,"Design and methods : In a prospective study , based in general practice , formerly undiagnosed subjects ( n = 464 ) were assessed at baseline and at 5 years for respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function."
17905823,"Odds ratios for early signs were calculated ( adjusted for age , gender , pack - years at baseline and smoking behaviour during follow - up ) , and defined as possible indicators of disease progression."
17905823,"Results : Over a 5 year period , the percentage of subjects with obstruction increased from 7.5 % ( n = 35 ) at baseline to 24.8 % ( n = 115 ) at 5 years."
17905823,The presence of mild early signs and lung function below the normal range at baseline were related to an increased risk of developing mild to moderate COPD ( GOLD I : OR 1.87 ( 95 % CI 1.22 to 2.87 ) ; GOLD II : OR 2.08 ( 95 % CI 1.29 to 3.37 ) to 2.54 ( 95 % CI 1.25 to 5.19 ) ) at 5 years.
17905823,Conclusion : Lung function below the normal range and early respiratory signs predict the development and progression of COPD.
32075787,"Objective : To describe the temporal and spatial trends of mortality and disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) due to chronic respiratory diseases , by age and sex , across the world during 1990 - 2017 using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017."
32075787,Design : Systematic analysis.
32075787,"Data source : The Global Burden of Diseases , Injuries , and Risk Factors Study 2017."
32075787,"Methods : Mortality and DALYs from chronic respiratory diseases were estimated from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 using DisMod - MR 2.1 , a Bayesian meta - regression tool."
32075787,The estimated annual percentage change of the age standardised mortality rate was calculated using a generalised linear model with a Gaussian distribution.
32075787,Mortality and DALYs were stratified according to the Socio - demographic index.
32075787,The strength and direction of the association between the Socio - demographic index and mortality rate were measured using the Spearman rank order correlation.
32075787,Risk factors for chronic respiratory diseases were analysed from exposure data.
32075787,"Results : Between 1990 and 2017 , the total number of deaths due to chronic respiratorydiseases increased by 18.0 % , from 3.32 ( 95 % uncertainty interval 3.01 to 3.43 ) million in 1990 to 3.91 ( 3.79 to 4.04 ) million in 2017."
32075787,The age standardised mortality rate of chronic respiratory diseases decreased by an average of 2.41 % ( 2.28 % to 2.55 % ) annually.
32075787,"During the 27 years , the annual decline in mortality rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ; 2.36 % , uncertainty interval 2.21 % to 2.50 % ) and pneumoconiosis ( 2.56 % , 2.44 % to 2.68 % ) has been slow , whereas the mortality rate for interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis ( 0.97 % , 0.92 % to 1.03 % ) has increased."
32075787,"Reductions in DALYs for asthma and pneumoconiosis have been seen , but DALYs due to COPD , and interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis have increased."
32075787,Mortality and the annual change in mortality rate due to chronic respiratory diseases varied considerably across 195 countries.
32075787,"Assessment of the factors responsible for regional variations in mortality and DALYs and the unequal distribution of improvements during the 27 years showed negative correlations between the Socio - demographic index and the mortality rates of COPD , pneumoconiosis , and asthma."
32075787,Regions with a low Socio - demographic index had the highest mortality and DALYs.
32075787,Smoking remained the major risk factor for mortality due to COPD and asthma.
32075787,Pollution from particulate matter was the major contributor to deaths from COPD in regions with a low Socio - demographic index.
32075787,"Since 2013 , a high body mass index has become the principal risk factor for asthma."
32075787,Conclusions : Regions with a low Socio - demographic index had the greatest burden of disease.
32075787,"The estimated contribution of risk factors ( such as smoking , environmental pollution , and a high body mass index ) to mortality and DALYs supports the need for urgent efforts to reduce exposure to them."
27296825,"Background : We sought to describe the theory used to design treatment adherence interventions , the content delivered , and the mode of delivery of these interventions in chronic respiratory disease."
27296825,Methods : We included randomized controlled trials of adherence interventions ( compared to another intervention or control ) in adults with chronic respiratory disease ( 8 databases searched ; inception until March 2015 ).
27296825,"Two reviewers screened and extracted data : post-intervention adherence ( measured objectively ) ; behavior change theory , content ( grouped into psychological , education and self - management / supportive , telemonitoring , shared decision - making ) ; and delivery."
27296825,""" Effective "" studies were those with p < 0.05 for adherence rate between groups."
27296825,We conducted a narrative synthesis and assessed risk of bias.
27296825,"Results : 12,488 articles screened ; 46 included studies ( n = 42,91 % in OSA or asthma ) testing 58 interventions ( n = 27 , 47 % were effective )."
27296825,Nineteen ( 33 % ) interventions ( 15 studies ) used 12 different behavior change theories.
27296825,"Use of theory ( n = 11,41 % ) was more common amongst effective interventions."
27296825,"Interventions were mainly educational , self - management or supportive interventions ( n = 27,47 % )."
27296825,"They were commonly delivered by a doctor ( n = 20,23 % ) , in face - to - face ( n = 48,70 % ) , one - to - one ( n = 45,78 % ) outpatient settings ( n = 46,79 % ) across 2 - 5 sessions ( n = 26,45 % ) for 1 - 3 months ( n = 26,45 % )."
27296825,"Doctors delivered a lower proportion ( n = 7,18 % vs n = 13,28 % ) and pharmacists ( n = 6,15 % vs n = 1,2 % ) a higher proportion of effective than ineffective interventions."
27296825,"Risk of bias was high in > 1 domain ( n = 43 , 93 % ) in most studies."
27296825,Conclusions : Behavior change theory was more commonly used to design effective interventions.
27296825,"Few adherence interventions have been developed using theory , representing a gap between intervention design recommendations and research practice."
3682138,One hundred one infants with chronic respiratory failure ( CRF ) who required prolonged mechanical ventilation were cared for in the pediatric intensive care unit at The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia between January 1967 and December 1984.
3682138,Chronic respiratory failure of infancy is a condition that requires mechanical ventilation for more than 28 days in the first year of life.
3682138,"Thirty - six children had severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia , 50 had congenital anomalies , and 15 had neuromuscular disorders."
3682138,The mean duration of mechanical ventilation for the 101 patients was 12.3 months.
3682138,"Seventy - one children were alive , and 53 ( 75 % ) of the 71 had been weaned from mechanical ventilation as of Dec 31 , 1984."
3682138,Pulmonary insufficiency and cardiac failure were the predominant causes of death in 17 of 22 infants in the first two years after the onset of CRF ; four of eight deaths that occurred beyond two years were caused by airway - and ventilator - related accidents.
3682138,"Mechanical ventilatory support was emphasized for as long as necessary to provide normal blood gas tensions , nutrition , growth , and development rather than weaning as rapidly as possible."
3682138,This clinical experience demonstrates that it is feasible to save over 70 % of infants with the severest forms of CRF and prolonged ventilator dependency.
15136374,Study objectives : To quantify the prevalence and impact of chronic respiratory symptoms among predominantly Alaska Native ( AN ) / American Indian ( AI ) middle school students.
15136374,"Design : School - based prevalence assessment using the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Children survey , with supplemental video material and added questions about productive cough , exposure to tobacco smoke , and the functional impact of symptoms."
15136374,Setting : The Yukon - Kuskokwim delta region of western Alaska.
15136374,"Participants : A total of 466 children in the sixth to ninth grades , 81 % of whom are AN / AI ( 377 children )."
15136374,Interventions : No study intervention.
15136374,"Results : Among the 377 AN / AI children , 40 % reported one of the following three categories of chronic respiratory disease : physician - diagnosed asthma , 7.4 % ; asthma - like symptoms ( ALS ) without an asthma diagnosis , 11.4 % ; and chronic productive cough ( CPC ) without asthma diagnosis or symptoms , 21.5 %."
15136374,Symptom prevalence differed substantially between the largest town in the region and rural villages.
15136374,"After an adjustment for demographic factors , exposure to environmental tobacco smoke , active tobacco smoking , and self - report of atopy , village residents were 63 % less likely to have ALS ( p = 0.009 ) , and had a twofold greater risk of CPC ( p < 0.001 ) compared to children living in the town."
15136374,Children with respiratory symptoms experienced sleep disturbances and accessed clinic visits for respiratory problems more often than did asymptomatic children.
15136374,Conclusions : Chronic respiratory symptoms are very common among AN children.
15136374,CPC is an important nonasthmatic respiratory condition in this population.
15136374,The differing patterns of respiratory illness within this region may help to elucidate the specific risk factors for asthma and chronic bronchitis in children.
24682773,Aspirin intolerance syndrome is due to disturbances in the arachidonic acid metabolism implicating both the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways.
24682773,"This results in imbalances of eicosanoid , leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis."
24682773,"Thus , preinflammatory cysteinyl leukotrienes increase and antiinflammatory prostaglandins ( PG ) such as PGE2 decrease."
24682773,"Clinically , intolerance reactions to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) can lead to different clinical manifestations ; five phenotypes of the aspirin intolerance syndrome are listed in the ENDA classification."
24682773,"Aspirin - exacerbated respiratory disease ( AERD ) is the most common phenotype characterized by an eosinophil - dominated inflammatory disease of the airways that presents clinically with nasal polyps , chronic sinusitis and bronchial asthma."
24682773,About 34 % of patients with aspirin - induced asthma and rhinosinusitis are thought to have AERD.
24682773,Important biochemical findings in many AERD patients are increased basal leukotriene levels ( at least in cell cultures ) that excessively increase after intake of COX - 1 inhibitors.
24682773,"Aspirin desensitization uses the repetitive application of aspirin to induce a tolerance to NSAIDs , especially COX - 1 inhibitors."
24682773,"After a dose - increase phase reaching a threshold dose , a dose - continuation phase is performed."
24682773,"For application , the nasal , bronchial , oral and intravenous routes have been described."
24682773,Aspirin desensitization has been proven to be efficacious and safe and was able to reduce the need for other medications in AERD patients.
10658536,Objectives : To investigate to what extent different components of air pollution are associated with acute respiratory health effects in children with and without chronic respiratory symptoms.
10658536,"Methods : During three consecutive winters starting in 1992 - 3 , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) and respiratory symptoms were registered daily in panels of children of 7 - 11 years old with and without symptoms , living in urban areas with high traffic intensity in The Netherlands."
10658536,"Simultaneously , panels of children living in non-urban areas were studied."
10658536,"Daily measurements of particles with aerodynamic diameter < 10 microns ( PM10 ) , black smoke ( BS ) , sulphate , SO2 , and NO2 were performed in both areas."
10658536,"Results : The contrast in particle concentrations ( PM10 , BS , and sulphate ) between urban and non-urban areas was small , but there was more contrast in the concentrations of SO2 and NO2."
10658536,"In children with symptoms from both areas , significant associations were found between PM10 , BS , and sulphate concentrations and the prevalence of symptoms of the lower respiratory tract ( LRS ) and decrements in PEF."
10658536,"Particle concentrations were also associated with use of bronchodilators in the urban areas , but not in the non-urban areas."
10658536,"After stratification by use of medication , stronger associations were found in children who used medication than in children who did not use medication."
10658536,"The magnitude of the estimated effects was in the order of a twofold increase in the use of bronchodilators , a 50 % increase in LRS , and an 80 % increase in decrements in PEF for a 100 micrograms / m3 increase in the 5 day mean PM10 concentration."
10658536,"In children without symptoms , significant associations were found between concentrations of PM10 and BS and decrements in PEF in both areas , but these associations were smaller than those for children with symptoms."
10658536,No associations with respiratory symptoms were found.
10658536,"Conclusions : The results suggest that children with symptoms are more susceptible to the effects of particulate air pollution than children without symptoms , and that use of medication for asthma does not prevent the adverse effects of particulate air pollution in children with symptoms."
18410643,Purpose : To measure enrollment of children with mechanical respiratory support needs within the Massachusetts early intervention programmes ( EIP ) and describe challenges in execution of individual family service plans ( IFSPs ).
18410643,Methods : Mixed methods provided a complementary assessment.
18410643,Quantitative data were collected in 2005 from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts EIP administrative database as part of a cross-sectional state census.
18410643,Qualitative data were retrieved from EIP regional coordinators in a key informant focus group.
18410643,Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative survey data.
18410643,"Audio - recordings were transcribed verbatim and a qualitative , thematic analysis was undertaken."
18410643,Results : Four hundred and eighty children requiring mechanical respiratory support at the time of EIP enrollment were identified between 1 July 1997 and 1 January 2005.
18410643,Focus group analysis revealed themes including : ( 1 ) barriers to community transition ; ( 2 ) community expertise and training ; ( 3 ) interface with medical providers ; and ( 4 ) the role of web - based resources.
18410643,"Isolation of families emerged as a recurrent and resounding concept , relating to all of the themes."
18410643,Conclusions : Findings support the assumption that implementation of IFSPs for the cohort of children with chronic mechanical respiratory support needs in EIPs is challenging.
18410643,"Barriers reflect inconsistent care coordination and practical encumbrances , contributing to the physical and social isolation of these children and their families."
10492269,"Study objectives : Previous studies have shown the acute effects of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) in chronic respiratory failure ; however , information on the chronic effects of NPPV is limited."
10492269,"We examined the acute and chronic effects of NPPV on gas exchange , functional status , and respiratory mechanics in patients with chronic respiratory failure related to restrictive ventilatory disorders or COPD."
10492269,Design : Descriptive analysis of prospectively collected clinical data.
10492269,Setting : Inpatient noninvasive respiratory care unit and outpatient clinic of university hospital.
10492269,Patients : Forty patients with chronic respiratory failure ( 20 with severe COPD and 20 with restrictive ventilatory disorders ).
10492269,"Interventions and measurements : All patients were admitted to a noninvasive respiratory care unit for 20 + / - 3 days for inpatient evaluation consisting of medical treatment , rehabilitation , and NPPV evaluation and instruction."
10492269,"NPPV was titrated via a ventilatory support system ( BiPAP ; Respironics Inc ; Monroeville , PA ) or a portable volume ventilator ( PLV 102 ; Lifecare , Inc ; Boulder , CO ) to achieve a > or = 20 % increase in baseline minute ventilation while monitoring gas exchange , expired volume , and clinical evidence of a decrease in the patient 's work of breathing."
10492269,"Results : The patients ' mean age ( + / - SD ) was 65 + / - 9.7 years , and there was a 3:1 female : male predominance."
10492269,"In the noninvasive respiratory care unit , 36 patients used NPPV for 7.31 + / - 0.26 h / night."
10492269,"Four patients ( three with COPD , one with restrictive disorder ) withdrew from the study during the 3 - week inpatient stay because they could not tolerate NPPV."
10492269,"Six patients ( 5 with COPD , 1 with restrictive disorder ) used a portable volume ventilator and 34 patients used BiPAP ( 15 with COPD , 19 with restrictive disorders )."
10492269,"At discharge , compared with at admission , daytime PaO2 / fraction of inspired oxygen ( FIO2 ) increased ( 327 + / - 10 vs 283 + / - 13 mm Hg ; p = 0.01 ) , PaCO2 was reduced ( 52 + / - 2 vs 67 + / - 3 mm Hg ; p = 0.0001 ) , and functional score increased ( 4.76 + / - 1.16 vs 2.7 + / - 1.64 arbitrary units ( AUs ) ; p < 0.01 )."
10492269,"Six months after discharge , improvements in PaO2 / FIO2 ( 317 + / - 10 vs 283 + / - 13 ; p = 0.05 ) , PaCO2 ( 52 + / - 2 vs 67 + / - 3 mm Hg ; p = 0.0001 ) , and functional score ( 5.66 + / - 0.41 vs 2.7 + / - 0.3 AUs ; p < 0.001 ) were maintained compared with admission values."
10492269,"FVC , FEV1 , and maximum inspired and expired mouth pressures were unchanged before and after long - term NPPV."
10492269,"Ten patients ( 7 with COPD , 3 with restrictive disorders ) discontinued NPPV at 6 months , and 3 progressed to tracheostomy."
10492269,The remaining 26 patients continued to use NPPV at the 6 - month follow - up.
10492269,"They claimed to use NPPV for 7.23 + / - 0.24 h / night , but logged metered use was 4.5 + / - 0.58 h / night."
10492269,"Problems that required adjustment in either the mask ( 36 % ) or ventilator source ( 36 % ) included mask leaks ( 43 % ) , skin irritation ( 22 % ) , rhinitis ( 13 % ) , aerophagia ( 13 % ) , and discomfort from mask headgear ( 7 % )."
10492269,"Conclusion : NPPV acutely and chronically improves gas exchange and functional status in patients with chronic respiratory failure , but a significant number of patients do not tolerate NPPV on a chronic basis."
10492269,Comprehensive follow - up is required to correct problems with NPPV and ensure optimal patient compliance.
8813839,A periodic breathing ( PB ) pattern is often observed in chronic heart failure ( CHF ) patients ( pts ).
8813839,"In order to clarify the role of this abnormal respiratory activity upon heart period variability we investigated , in a group of 20 stable CHF pts ( NYHA class II to III , median EF 24 % ) showing a PB pattern , 1 ) whether observed data were consistent with the instability hypothesis of PB and 2 ) the relationship between oscillations of heart period and the contemporary fluctuations of ventilatory and chemoreceptor activity."
8813839,"Univariate and bivariate spectral analysis were performed on short - term resting recordings of instantaneous lung volume ( ILV ) , instantaneous minute ventilation ( IMV ) , heart period ( HP ) and arterial O2 saturation at the ear ( SpO2 )."
8813839,"A very low frequency ( VLF ) oscillation around 0.02 Hz , associated with PB , was observed in all signals and contributed to 75 % ( 23 divided by .99 ) ( median ( range ) ) of the HP variability."
8813839,A high coherence was also found between IMV and SpO2 : 0.9 ( 0.6 divided by 0.98 ).
8813839,"The median phase lag between IMB and SpO2 was -211 degrees ( - 240 divided by -156 ) , between ILV and HP -205 degrees ( - 260 divided by -180 ) and between SpO2 and HP 0 degree ( - 26 divided by 30 )."
8813839,The estimated lung - to - ear circulation time was 24.5 s ( 12.5 divided by 36.5 ).
8813839,"This study definitely confirms that during PB a common rhythm is shared between the respiratory and cardiovascular regulatory system Taking into account the error introduced by the measuring process , our results , are consistent with the hypothesis that periodic breathing of CHF pts originates from an instability of the feedback control system of ventilation."
8813839,Hence most of the HP variability of these pts simply reflects abnormal pattern of respiratory activity.
11939462,Objective : The relationship of respiratory symptoms to pulmonary function parameters and smoking status was assessed in subjects with chronic ( > 1 year ) spinal cord injury ( SCI ).
11939462,"Methods and participants : As part of their annual physical examination , subjects were queried regarding respiratory symptoms and underwent pulmonary function studies."
11939462,"The 180 patients who successfully completed pulmonary function testing were evaluated , including 79 subjects with tetraplegia ( 56 nonsmokers and 23 smokers ) and 101 subjects with paraplegia ( 78 nonsmokers and 23 smokers )."
11939462,"Findings : Logistic - regression analysis revealed the following independent predictors of breathlessness : level of injury ( tetraplegia , paraplegia , odds ratio = 3.5 , P < 0.0015 ) , cough combined with phlegm and / or wheeze ( CPWZ , odds ratio = 3.1 , P < 0.015 ) , total lung capacity percentage predicted ( TLC < 60 % , odds ratio = 3.9 , P < 0.02 ) , and expiratory reserve volume ( ERV < 0.6 L , odds ratio = 2.5 , P < 0.05 )."
11939462,"Independent predictors of CPWZ were current smoking ( odds ratio = 3.3 , P < 0.004 ) , breathlessness ( odds ratio = 2.9 , P < 0.03 ) , and forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 < 60 % , odds ratio = 3.2 , P < 0.01 )."
11939462,"Conclusion : Altered respiratory mechanics associated with tetraplegia contribute to breathlessness , restrictive ventilatory impairment ( low TLC % ) , and reduced expiratory muscle strength ( low ERV )."
11939462,These factors apparently overshadow adverse effects caused by smoking.
11939462,"Conversely , smoking and reduction of airflow ( low FEV1 % ) were predictive of CPWZ , symptoms commonly associated with cigarette use."
30122917,"Purpose : Chronic respiratory disease ( CRD ) including COPD carries high and rising morbidity and mortality in Africa , but there are few available treatments."
30122917,"Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) is a non-pharmacological treatment with proven benefits in improving symptoms and exercise capacity , which has not been tested in Africa."
30122917,"We aimed to evaluate the lived experience of people with CRD , including physical and psychosocial impacts , and how these are addressed by PR."
30122917,"Patients and methods : A team of respiratory specialists , nurses , and physiotherapists implemented PR to meet the clinical and cultural setting."
30122917,"PR consisted of a 6 - week , twice - weekly program of exercise and self - management education."
30122917,Forty - two patients were recruited.
30122917,"Qualitative data were collected through interviews with patients at baseline and six weeks post-completion , focus group discussions , ethnographic observations , and brief interviews."
30122917,"Results : Before and after PR , a total of 44 semi-structured interviews , 3 focus group discussions , and 4 ethnographic observations with brief interviews were conducted."
30122917,"Participants reported profound problems with respiratory symptoms , functional impairment , wide - reaching economic and psychological impacts , and social isolation."
30122917,Patients who were debilitated by their condition before PR reported that PR addressed all their major concerns.
30122917,"It was reported that breathlessness , pain , immobility , weight loss , and other CRD - related symptoms were reduced , and social and intimate relationships were improved."
30122917,"Local materials were used to improvise the exercises , enabling some to be maintained at home."
30122917,"Recommendations for future PR programs included patient information to take home as a reminder of the exercises , and to show their families , and the support of a community health worker to help maintenance of exercises at home."
30122917,"Conclusion : PR has the potential to restore the physical , mental , and social functioning in patients with CRD , whereas medication has much more narrow effects."
30122917,PR offers a major new option for treatment of a neglected group of patients.
26814219,Background : Recent studies show balance impairment in subjects with chronic respiratory disease.
26814219,The aim of this proof - of - concept study was to investigate clinical and quantitative measures of balance in people with chronic respiratory disease following participation in an out - patient pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) program to better understand features of balance improvement.
26814219,A secondary aim was to probe possible mechanisms for balance improvement to provide the foundation for optimal design of future studies.
26814219,Methods : Eleven individuals with chronic respiratory disease enrolled in an 8 - week out - patient PR program participated.
26814219,"Standing balance , measured with a force plate , in the medial - lateral and anterior - posterior directions with eyes open and closed was assessed with linear ( SD and sway path length ) and non-linear ( diffusion analysis ) center - of - pressure measures."
26814219,Balance was evaluated clinically with the Timed Up and Go and Four Square Step Test.
26814219,Fear of falling and balance confidence were assessed with questionnaires.
26814219,"Results : After participation in PR , medial - lateral sway path length decreased ( P = .031 ) , and center - of - pressure diffusion in the medial - lateral direction was slower ( P = .02 ) and traveled over less distance ( P = .03 ) with eyes closed."
26814219,This suggests greater control of medial - lateral sway.
26814219,There was no change in anterior - posterior balance ( P > .067 ).
26814219,"Performance improved on the Timed Up and Go ( median [ interquartile range ] pre-PR = 9.4 [ 7.9 - 12.8 ] vs. post-PR = 8.1 [ 7.3 - 12.2 ] s , P = .003 ) and Four Square Step Test ( median [ interquartile range ] pre-PR = 9.3 [ 7.2 - 14.2 ] vs. post-PR = 8.7 [ 7.4 - 10.2 ] s , P = .050 )."
26814219,There were no changes in balance confidence ( P = .72 ) or fear of falling ( P = .57 ).
26814219,"Conclusions : Participation in an 8 - week out - patient PR program improved balance , as assessed by clinical and laboratory measures."
26814219,Detailed analysis of force plate measures demonstrated improvements primarily with respect to medial - lateral balance control.
26814219,These data provide a basis for the development of larger scale studies to investigate the mechanisms for medial - lateral balance improvements following PR and to determine how PR may be refined to enhance balance outcomes in this population.

15083764,"Oxygen ( O2 ) desaturation may occur in patients affected by respiratory diseases during daily activities , although most of these activities , e.g. walking , washing and cooking , can be avoided or eventually performed with an external aid."
15083764,"In this prospective study , the respiratory changes induced by the mandatory effort of defecation were assessed in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency."
15083764,"Twenty - four consecutive patients with chronic respiratory failure due to obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disorders , showing a marked O2 desaturation during the 6 - min walk test , were enrolled."
15083764,"Thirteen of them were already established on long - term O2 therapy ( LTOT ) , while 11 were not."
15083764,"O2 saturation ( Sa , O2 ) , respiratory rate ( RR ) , cardiac frequency ( fC ) and dyspnoea were measured at rest , and during and after defecation."
15083764,"Sa , O2 decreased significantly during defecation , while RR , fC and dyspnoea increased , both in the subgroup of patients without significant resting hypoxaemia and in the subgroup of patients receiving their usual resting flow of LTOT , as compared to resting values."
15083764,"In conclusion , the respiratory system of patients with chronic respiratory failure may be significantly strained by defecation."
13765497,A survey of respiratory symptoms and function was carried out in Dundee among 123 men and women in the jute industry and 242 in the flax industry.
13765497,The selection of workers was biassed in favour of those working in the dustier departments as judged by eye and those in the older age groups.
13765497,A group of 72 men in a heavy engineering firm were also selected as controls for comparison.
13765497,"Chronic bronchitis , as defined by Ogilvie and Newell ( 1957 ) was recorded in 27 % of those interviewed , whose average age was 49."
13765497,"Byssinosis of various grades was recorded in 30 % of all working in flax ; of these 35 had cough alone worse on Monday , 34 had other respiratory symptoms worse on Monday and in only four persons did the exacerbation persist longer in the week."
13765497,"In spite of the occurrence of byssinosis , chronic bronchitis was no more prevalent among flax workers than among the others , the average ventilatory function was no worse , and radiographs of the chest revealed no differences."
13765497,"The characteristic fall in expiratory flow rate during the course of exposure to flax dust on Mondays is similar to that found in cotton workers , and is absent in jute workers and in flax workers not admitting to symptoms of byssinosis."
24062297,Background : Arsenic exposure via drinking water increases the risk of chronic respiratory disease in adults.
24062297,"However , information on pulmonary health effects in children after early life exposure is limited."
24062297,"Methods : This population - based cohort study set in rural Matlab , Bangladesh , assessed lung function and respiratory symptoms of 650 children aged 7 - 17 years."
24062297,Children with in utero and early life arsenic exposure were compared with children exposed to less than 10 µg / l in utero and throughout childhood.
24062297,"Because most children drank the same water as their mother had drunk during pregnancy , we could not assess only in utero or only childhood exposure."
24062297,"Results : Children exposed in utero to more than 500 µg / l of arsenic were more than eight times more likely to report wheezing when not having a cold [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 8.41 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.66 - 42.6 , P < 0.01 ] and more than three times more likely to report shortness of breath when walking on level ground ( OR = 3.86 , 95 % CI : 1.09 - 13.7 , P = 0.02 ) and when walking fast or climbing ( OR = 3.19 , 95 % CI : 1.22 - 8.32 , P < 0.01 ]."
24062297,"However , there was little evidence of reduced lung function in either exposure category."
24062297,"Conclusions : Children with high in utero and early life arsenic exposure had marked increases in several chronic respiratory symptoms , which could be due to in utero exposure or to early life exposure , or to both."
24062297,Our findings suggest that arsenic in water has early pulmonary effects and that respiratory symptoms are a better marker of early life arsenic toxicity than changes in lung function measured by spirometry.
26525282,Traditional Chinese exercise ( TCE ) has many uses in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.
26525282,"However , there is no consensus regarding the benefit of TCE for chronic diseases."
26525282,Our objective is to examine the effect of TCE on the quality of life and depression for chronic diseases by performing a meta - analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ).
26525282,We only cover published RCTs.
26525282,The outcome measures included quality of life and depression.
26525282,Sixty articles with a total of 4311 patients were included.
26525282,"The pooling revealed that TCE could improve the SF - 36 physical function subscale in the short term [ SMD ( 95 % CI ) = 0.35 ( 0.13 , 0.56 ) , P = 0.002 ] and mid-term [ SMD ( 95 % CI ) = 0.49 ( 0.12 , 0.85 ) , P = 0.009 ] , GHQ [ SMD ( 95 % CI ) = -0.68 ( - 1.26 , -0.09 ) , P = 0.02 ] , the Center for Epidemiologic Studies depression scale in the short term [ SMD ( 95 % CI ) = -0.86 ( - 1.42 , -0.31 ) , P = 0.002 ] and mid-term [ SMD ( 95 % CI ) = -0.41 ( - 0.64 , -0.18 ) , P < 0.001 ]."
26525282,The meta - analysis of RCT demonstrates that TCE can significantly improve the quality of life and depression of patients with chronic diseases.
26525282,These findings provide useful information for patients with chronic diseases as well as for medical staff.
30300400,Background : Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) is a common complication of chronic respiratory disease.
30300400,"Recent studies have reported diabetes mellitus ( DM ) to be a poor prognostic factor in patients with chronic respiratory disease , including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial pneumoniae."
30300400,"However , the association between DM and PH in chronic respiratory disease remains unclear."
30300400,"In this study , we aimed to investigate whether DM is a predictor of PH in patients with chronic respiratory disease."
30300400,Methods : We prospectively analyzed 386 patients in our hospital with chronic respiratory disease.
30300400,"An echocardiographic pressure gradient between the right atrium and the right ventricle of ≥ 40 mmHg was defined as PH. We compared the clinical characteristics and impact of DM between chronic respiratory disease patients with and those without PH. Results : Of the 386 patients , 42 ( 10.9 % ) were diagnosed as having PH. The PH group had higher modified medical research council ( mMRC ) grade and complication rate of DM , but not hypertension and hyperlipidemia , when compared to the non-PH group."
30300400,"Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that mMRC scale ( odds ratio 1.702 , 95 % confidence interval , 1.297 to 2.232 , P < 0.001 ) and presence of DM ( odd ratio 2.935 , 95 % confidence interval , 1.505 to 5.725 , P = 0.002 ) were associated with PH in chronic respiratory disease patients."
30300400,Conclusion : DM is potentially associated with PH and is an independent factor for prediction of PH in patients with chronic respiratory disease.
28393258,Purpose : Early noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) after extubation decreases the risk of respiratory failure and lowers 90 - day mortality in patients with hypercapnia.
28393258,Patients with chronic respiratory disease are at risk of extubation failure.
28393258,"Therefore , it could be useful to determine the role of NIV with a discontinuous approach , not limited to patients with hypercapnia."
28393258,We assessed the efficacy of early NIV in decreasing respiratory failure after extubation in patients with chronic respiratory disorders.
28393258,Methods : A prospective randomized controlled multicenter study was conducted.
28393258,We enrolled 144 mechanically ventilated patients with chronic respiratory disorders who tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial.
28393258,"Patients were randomly allocated after extubation to receive either NIV ( NIV group , n = 72 ) , performed with a discontinuous approach , for the first 48 h , or conventional oxygen treatment ( usual care group , n = 72 )."
28393258,The primary endpoint was decreased respiratory failure within 48 h after extubation.
28393258,Analysis was by intention to treat.
28393258,This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01047852 ).
28393258,Results : Respiratory failure after extubation was less frequent in the NIV group : 6 ( 8.5 % ) versus 20 ( 27.8 % ) ; p = 0.0016.
28393258,Six patients ( 8.5 % ) in the NIV group versus 13 ( 18.1 % ) in the usual care group were reintubated ; p = 0.09.
28393258,"Intensive care unit ( ICU ) mortality and 90 - day mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups ( p = 0.28 and p = 0.33 , respectively )."
28393258,Median postrandomization ICU length of stay was lower in the usual care group : 3 days ( IQR 2 - 6 ) versus 4 days ( IQR 2 - 7 ; p = 0.008 ).
28393258,Patients with hypercapnia during a spontaneous breathing trial were at risk of developing postextubation respiratory failure [ adjusted odds ratio ( 95 % CI ) = 4.56 ( 1.59 - 14.00 ) ; p = 0.006 ] and being intubated [ adjusted odds ratio ( 95 % CI ) = 3.60 ( 1.07 - 13.31 ) ; p = 0.04 ].
28393258,Conclusions : Early NIV performed following a sequential protocol for the first 48 h after extubation decreased the risk of respiratory failure in patients with chronic respiratory disorders.
28393258,Reintubation and mortality did not differ between NIV and conventional oxygen therapy.

20588002,Background : Noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) has been found to be an essential technique to treat chronic respiratory failure ( CRF ) resulting from restrictive thoracic disorders ( RTD ).
20588002,"The last decades were characterized by the expansion of NIV to treat patients suffering from various other conditions , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome ( OHS )."
20588002,Objectives : The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of NIV on health - related quality of life ( HRQoL ) of patients with CRF during 2 years and to identify parameters associated with changes in HRQoL.
20588002,Methods : Ninety - one patients with CRF [ 35 COPD ; 17 RTD ; 28 OHS ; 11 neuromuscular diseases ( NMD ) ] participated.
20588002,HRQoL was assessed with the SF - 36 questionnaire.
20588002,"Additional measurements included blood gases , pulmonary function tests , dyspnea , daytime sleepiness , exacerbations and hospitalizations."
20588002,The patients were evaluated every 3 - 6 months.
20588002,"Results : Improvements in SF - 36 physical component summary ( PCS , p < 0.0001 ) and mental component summary ( MCS , p < 0.0001 ) scores in RTD and MCS in OHS ( p = 0.01 ) and COPD ( p = 0.003 ) were observed by the third month."
20588002,"PCS in OHS and COPD patients improved by the sixth month ( p = 0.003 and p < 0.0001 , respectively )."
20588002,NMD patients did not present improvements in HRQoL.
20588002,"Improvements in HRQoL were associated with improvements in PaO ( 2 ) and dyspnea in COPD patients , and with total hours of daily ventilator use , improvement in dyspnea , pressure support and expiratory positive airway pressure in RTD patients."
20588002,Conclusion : Home NIV is consistently effective in improving HRQoL and physiological parameters in patients with CRF.
20588002,Randomized trials to identify subgroups of COPD responders are justified by our results.
32711487,Background : The burgeoning rise of non-communicable diseases ( NCDs ) is posing serious challenges in resource constrained health facilities of Nepal.
32711487,"The main objective of this study was to assess the readiness of health facilities for cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs ) , diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases ( CRDs ) services in Nepal."
32711487,Methods : This study utilized data from the Nepal Health Facility Survey 2015.
32711487,"General readiness of 940 health facilities along with disease specific readiness for CVDs , diabetes , and CRDs were assessed using the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual of the World Health Organization."
32711487,Health facilities were categorized into public and private facilities.
32711487,"Results : Out of a total of 940 health facilities assessed , private facilities showed higher availability of items of general service readiness except for standard precautions for infection prevention , compared to public facilities."
32711487,"The multivariable adjusted regression coefficients for CVDs ( β = 2.87 , 95 % CI : 2.42 - 3.39 ) , diabetes ( β = 3.02 , 95 % CI : 2.03 - 4.49 ) , and CRDs ( β = 15.95 , 95 % CI : 4.61 - 55.13 ) at private facilities were higher than the public facilities."
32711487,"Health facilities located in the hills had a higher readiness index for CVDs ( β = 1.99 , 95 % CI : 1.02 - 1.39 )."
32711487,"Service readiness for CVDs ( β = 1.13 , 95 % CI : 1.04 - 1.23 ) and diabetes ( β = 1.78 , 95 % CI : 1.23 - 2.59 ) were higher in the urban municipalities than in rural municipalities."
32711487,"Finally , disease - related services readiness index was sub-optimal with some degree of variation at the province level in Nepal."
32711487,"Compared to province 1 , province 2 ( β = 0.83 , 95 % CI : 0.73 - 0.95 ) had lower , and province 4 ( β = 1.24 , 95 % CI : 1.07 - 1.43 ) and province 5 ( β = 1.17 , 95 % CI : 1.02 - 1.34 ) had higher readiness index for CVDs."
32711487,Conclusion : This study found sub-optimal readiness of services related to three NCDs at the public facilities in Nepal.
32711487,"Compared to public facilities , private facilities showed higher readiness scores for CVDs , diabetes , and CRDs."
32711487,"There is an urgent need for policy reform to improve the health services for NCDs , particularly in public facilities."
30508589,Purpose : To evaluate the utility of the forced oscillation technique ( FOT ) among military veterans with preserved spirometry and chronic unexplained respiratory symptoms.
30508589,Methods : 178 veterans referred for evaluation of unexplained respiratory symptoms completed pulmonary function testing and FOT.
30508589,"Preserved spirometry was defined as FEV1 / FVC , FEV1 and FVC ≥ 5th percentile."
30508589,"Frequency dependence of resistance ( R4 - R20 ) and reactance area ( AX ) were assessed via FOT , and R4 - R20 ≥ 20 % and AX ≥ 95th percentile were considered abnormal."
30508589,"Results : Spirometry was preserved in 71.3 % , of whom 124 had acceptable FOT data."
30508589,93 of 124 ( 75.0 % ) veterans with preserved spirometry had one or more abnormal findings on FOT.
30508589,"Veterans with abnormal R4 - R20 and / or AX had reduced FVC , FEV1 , FEF25 - 75 , and diffusing capacity ( % predicted ) in comparison to those with Normal FOT ( p = 0.030 to p < 0.001 )."
30508589,"Conclusions : In our referral sample , distal airway dysfunction in the presence of preserved spirometry appears common and may represent an at - risk group requiring closer surveillance."
25247967,"Objective : In lung cancer screening , the prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms is high among heavy smokers."
25247967,The purpose of this study was to compare CT - derived airway wall measurements between male smokers with and those without chronic respiratory symptoms.
25247967,"Materials and methods : Fifty male heavy smokers with chronic respiratory symptoms ( cough , excessive mucus secretion , dyspnea , and wheezing ) and 50 without any respiratory symptom were randomly selected from the Dutch - Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial."
25247967,Thin - slice low - dose CT images were evaluated with dedicated software for airway measurements.
25247967,Wall area percentage and airway wall thickness were measured from trachea to bronchi in five different pulmonary lobes of airways with a luminal diameter of 5 mm or greater.
25247967,"Association between airway wall measurements and respiratory symptoms was analyzed by multiple linear regression adjusted for age , body mass index , smoking status , emphysema , and pulmonary function."
25247967,"Results : After adjustment for relevant factors , a significant positive association between airway wall measurements and respiratory symptoms was found in airways with a luminal diameter between 5 to 10 mm ( p < 0.01 ) , but not in airways measuring 10 mm or greater ( p > 0.05 )."
25247967,"At the airway level between 5 to 10 mm , the mean wall area percentages were 51.5 % ± 7.9 %."
25247967,Airway wall thicknesses were 1.54 ± 0.39 mm and 1.37 ± 0.35 mm ( p < 0.001 ).
25247967,"Conclusion : Male heavy smokers with chronic respiratory symptoms in lung cancer screening , who are at high - risk of chronic bronchitis , have bronchial wall thickening in airways with a luminal diameter of 5 - 10 mm but not in larger airways."
2400226,Twenty one surviving infants of pregnancies complicated by rupture of the membranes during the second trimester that lasted at least one week have been followed up for a median of 15 months.
2400226,Five infants ( 24 % ) had recurrent respiratory problems ( episodes of wheezing and coughing occurring at least once a week ) which related significantly to the use of neonatal ventilation and to very preterm delivery.
2400226,Five of the 18 infants who were born preterm and with birth weights of less than 2500 g had recurrent respiratory symptoms ( 28 % ).
2400226,This compares favourably with an incidence of symptoms of 67 % among surviving low birthweight infants born at this hospital after pregnancies not complicated by premature rupture of the membranes.
2400226,Neither recurrent respiratory symptoms nor admission to hospital for chest related disorders were associated with the timing of onset or duration of rupture of the membranes.
2400226,"We conclude that , among survivors of premature rupture of the membranes , chronic respiratory morbidity would best be prevented by avoiding very preterm delivery , regardless of the duration of the rupture."
8518776,"Acute respiratory failure is usually managed by means of mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy , when conservative treatment fails."
8518776,Invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with several complications.
8518776,"The recent development of non-invasive methods of ventilation , has led to an attempt to avoid the complications of invasive mechanical ventilation during episodes of acute respiratory failure , ensuring at the same time a similar degree of efficacy."
8518776,Both intermittent negative pressure ventilation and positive pressure ventilation by face or nasal mask have recently been used for this purpose.
8518776,"Negative pressure ventilation by means of iron lung , cuirass or poncho - wrap ventilators , has never been used in place of endotracheal intubation , and studies of this kind of ventilation are inconclusive : as a consequence , there is , at the moment , no indication for the generalized use of negative pressure ventilation in acute respiratory failure."
8518776,"Intermittent positive pressure ventilation by facial or nasal masks , has recently been used in the treatment of respiratory failure in place of endotracheal intubation."
8518776,"The results are promising , but remain controversial."
8518776,"It may be attempted in selected patients with obstructive respiratory disorders , but the procedure is very time - consuming for nurses."
9601443,"Patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , chronic pain and respiratory disorder were investigated for different patterns of psychological factors."
9601443,"Several psychological factors were measured : depression ( using Beck 's ' BDI ' ) , anxiety ( using Spielberger 's ' STAI ' ) , anger ( Spielberger 's ' AX ' ) , and cynicism ( Greenglass & Julkunen 's ' CD ' )."
9601443,"The special psychological pattern in patients with CHD was characterized by an increase in suppressed anger , overall experienced anger , and cynicism."
9601443,Patients with chronic pain did not show any comparable pattern of elevated psychological factors.
9601443,"The pattern in patients with respiratory disorder was characterized by increased cynicism and , in women , also clinical depression."
28532487,Background : Dyspnoea is a disabling symptom in patients admitted with heart failure ( HF ) and respiratory diseases ( RD ).
28532487,The main aim of this study is to evaluate its intensity at admission and discharge and the relation with quality of life.
28532487,"We also describe its management , intensity , and evolution in HF and RD. Methods : In this descriptive , cross-sectional study , we included prospectively all patients admitted with decompensated HF and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) / pulmonary fibrosis during 4 months."
28532487,Surveys quantifying dyspnoea ( Numerical Rating Scale 1 - 10 ) and quality of life ( EuroQoL 5d ) were administered at discharge.
28532487,Results : A total of 258 patients were included : 190 ( 73.6 % ) with HF and 68 ( 26.4 % ) with RD ( 62 COPD and 6 pulmonary fibrosis ).
28532487,"Mean age was 74.0 ± 1.2 years , and 157 ( 60.6 % ) were men."
28532487,Dyspnoea before admission was 7.5 ± 0.1.
28532487,"Patients with RD showed greater dyspnoea than those with HF both before admission ( 8.1 ± 0.2 vs. 7.3 ± 0.2 , p = 0.01 ) and at discharge ( 3.2 ± 0.3 vs. 2.0 ± 0.2 , p = 0.0001 )."
28532487,"They also presented a higher rate of severe dyspnoea ( ≥ 5 ) at discharge ( 23 [ 34.3 % ] vs. 36 [ 19.1 % ] , p = 0.02 )."
28532487,"Opioids were used in 41 ( 15.9 % ) , mean dose 8.7 ± 0.8 mg Morphine Equivalent Daily Dose."
28532487,Conclusions : About a quarter of patients admitted with HF or RD persist with severe dyspnoea at discharge.
28532487,Opioids are probably underused.
28532487,HF patients have less dyspnoea than patients with RD but present worse quality of life.
23491405,Rationale : The heat - related risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases among the elderly has not been quantified in the United States on a national scale.
23491405,"With climate change predictions of more frequent and more intense heat waves , it is of paramount importance to quantify the health risks related to heat , especially for the most vulnerable."
23491405,Objectives : To estimate the risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases associated with outdoor heat in the U.S. elderly.
23491405,"Methods : An observational study of approximately 12.5 million Medicare beneficiaries in 213 United States counties , January 1 , 1999 to December 31 , 2008."
23491405,We estimate a national average relative risk of hospitalization for each 10 °F ( 5.6 °C ) increase in daily outdoor temperature using Bayesian hierarchical models.
23491405,"Measurements and main results : We obtained daily county - level rates of Medicare emergency respiratory hospitalizations ( International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision , 464 - 466 , 480 - 487 , 490 - 492 ) in 213 U.S. counties from 1999 through 2008."
23491405,"Overall , each 10 °F increase in daily temperature was associated with a 4.3 % increase in same - day emergency hospitalizations for respiratory diseases ( 95 % posterior interval , 3.8 , 4.8 % )."
23491405,Counties ' relative risks were significantly higher in counties with cooler average summer temperatures.
23491405,Conclusions : We found strong evidence of an association between outdoor heat and respiratory hospitalizations in the largest population of elderly studied to date.
23491405,"Given projections of increasing temperatures from climate change and the increasing global prevalence of chronic pulmonary disease , the relationship between heat and respiratory morbidity is a growing concern."
29156003,Background : Few studies have analysed the impact of chronic respiratory disease ( CRD ) on outcomes in dialysis.
29156003,"We therefore sought to describe patients with CRD and end - stage renal disease and their outcomes after dialysis start , compared with patients without CRD , focusing especially on causes of death , access to renal transplantation and causes of hospital admissions."
29156003,Methods : The study included 52 797 adults aged 18 years and older who began dialysis from 2008 to 2013 and are recorded in the French national REIN registry.
29156003,"Survival , specific mortality and access to the waiting list and to renal transplantation were analysed , with adjustment for various comorbidities and consideration of competitive risks."
29156003,"The numbers of hospitalizations and hospital days , together with their causes , were analysed through an indirect link between the REIN database and the national French hospital discharge database."
29156003,"Results : The frequency of CRD at dialysis start was 12 % and was associated with various other comorbidities , including obesity and tobacco use."
29156003,"After adjustment for those comorbidities , CRD remained associated with a higher risk of death [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 1.20 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.16 - 1.25 ]."
29156003,"Patients with CRD were 30 % less likely to undergo transplantation ( HR 0.67 , 95 % CI 0.6 - 0.7 ) than patients without CRD."
29156003,Their risk of dying from a respiratory disease was 8.8 times higher ; their risk of dying from infection was also higher.
29156003,"Patients with CRD had a higher rate of admissions and more hospital days , for all causes and for every cause , except cancer."
29156003,Conclusions : CRD was associated with higher risks of death and hospital admissions and with lower likelihoods of being wait - listed for and undergoing renal transplantation.
29156003,Increasing clinical awareness by patients and doctors and encouragement of spirometry use should promote more accurate clinical diagnosis and better preventive care for CRD.
32723859,Background : Oxygen therapy represents the elective therapy to improve the quality of life for patients with chronic respiratory diseases like COPD and interstitial lung disease.
32723859,Lightweight portable oxygen concentrators ( POCs ) are a valid alternative to traditional systems such as portable compressed oxygen cylinders.
32723859,"However , patient preference and the possible psychological implications related to the use of both devices have been poorly assessed."
32723859,"We sought to evaluate patient preference between the ambulatory oxygen systems ( ie , a POC or a small cylinder ) for patients with COPD and interstitial lung disease experiencing exertional desaturation in a rehabilitation setting."
32723859,"Furthermore , the use of one device in comparison with the other was related to specific mechanical characteristics and related to perceived quality of life , anxiety , and depressive symptoms."
32723859,"Methods : 30 subjects with COPD and interstitial lung disease , who demonstrated exertional desaturation on room air during 6 - min walk test ( 6MWT ) , were recruited."
32723859,"Each subject performed 2 6MWTs , in random order : one breathing oxygen via a POC and one with a portable compressed oxygen cylinder."
32723859,Both devices were set up to ensure oxyhemoglobin saturation between 92 % and 95 % during the 6MWTs.
32723859,"All subjects completed a questionnaire assessing anxiety , depression , and quality of life."
32723859,"Each device was randomly assigned to each subject for 1 week , and then replaced with the other in the following week."
32723859,"At the end of the trial period , all subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating several aspects of the oxygen therapy devices."
32723859,Results : There were no significant differences in oxygen saturation or the mean distances achieved during the 6MWTs between the 2 portable oxygen devices.
32723859,"The subjects expressed greater preference for the POC ( 73.3 % ) , basing their choice mainly on ease of transport and lower weight."
32723859,"Subjects ' age also correlated with preferences : younger subjects were more negatively focused on the weight of the portable compressed oxygen cylinder , whereas older subjects considered the POC easier to manage."
32723859,No significant differences in preferences were present between COPD and interstitial lung disease.
32723859,Conclusions : The POC and the portable compressed oxygen cylinder performed in a comparable manner during 6MWT for subjects with COPD and interstitial lung disease and exertional desaturation.
32723859,Subjects preferred the POC because it was associated with better mobility.
17901161,"Background : A reduced dietary intake of n - 3 fatty acids , in association with increased n - 6 fatty acid intake , has been proposed as a potential aetiological factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and asthma."
17901161,"However , the relative importance of individual fatty acids within the n - 3 and n - 6 categories on this effect has not been widely investigated."
17901161,"We have studied the relation between individual fatty acid intakes , lung function and self - reported respiratory symptoms and diagnoses in a representative sample of more than 13,000 Dutch adults."
17901161,"Methods : Intake of individual fatty acids was estimated by a food frequency questionnaire and analysed in relation to measures of forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV1 ) and to questionnaire reported wheeze , asthma and COPD symptoms."
17901161,"Results : After adjusting for confounding , we found no protective association between individual n - 3 fatty acid intakes and FEV1."
17901161,"Higher intakes of some n - 6 fatty acids were associated with lower FEV1 , this effect being most marked for c22 : 4 n - 6 docosatetraenoic acid ( reduction in FEV1 between the highest and lowest quintile of intake 54.5 ml ( 95 % CI -81.6 to -27.4 ) )."
17901161,"Most of the n - 6 fatty acid effects interacted significantly with smoking , their effects being strongest in current smokers."
17901161,"Individual n - 3 fatty acid intakes were generally associated with a higher risk of wheeze in the past year , but otherwise there was little or no association between fatty acid intake and wheeze , doctor diagnosed asthma or other respiratory symptoms."
17901161,"Conclusions : A high intake of n - 3 fatty acids does not appear to protect against COPD or asthma , but a high intake of several n - 6 fatty acids is associated with a significant reduction in FEV1 , particularly in smokers."
17901161,"These findings indicate that high dietary intake of n - 6 fatty acids , rather than reduced n - 3 intake , may have an adverse effect on lung health."
21533826,Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia ( CPEO ) is a relatively common mitochondrial disorder.
21533826,"Weakness of the extra-ocular , limb girdle and laryngeal muscles are established clinical features."
21533826,"Respiratory muscle involvement however has never been studied systematically , even though respiratory complications are one of the main causes of death."
21533826,We therefore determined the prevalence and nature of respiratory muscle involvement in 23 patients with genetically confirmed CPEO.
21533826,"The main finding was decreased respiratory muscle strength , both expiratory ( 76.8 % of predicted , p = 0.002 ) and inspiratory ( 79.5 % of predicted , p = 0.004 )."
21533826,"Although the inspiratory vital capacity ( 92.5 % of predicted , p = 0.021 ) and the forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( 89.3 % of predicted , p = 0.002 ) were below predicted values , both were still within the normal range in the majority of patients."
21533826,"Expiratory weakness was associated with a decreased vital capacity ( ρ = 0.502 , p = 0.015 ) and decreased peak expiratory flow ( ρ = 0.422 , p = 0.045 )."
21533826,"Moreover , expiratory muscle strength was lower in patients with limb girdle weakness ( 62.6 ± 26.1 % of predicted vs. 98.9 ± 22.5 % in patients with normal limb girdle strength , p = 0.003 ) , but was not associated with other clinical features , subjective respiratory complaints , disease severity or disease duration."
21533826,"Since respiratory involvement in CPEO is associated with severe morbidity and mortality , the present data justify periodic assessment of respiratory functions in all CPEO patients."
16039838,Study objectives : This study was aimed at assessing health - related quality of life ( HRQL ) in patients with chronic respiratory failure ( CRF ) and long - term survival following prolonged intensive care mechanical ventilation.
16039838,Design : Observational cohort study.
16039838,Setting : Patients with CRF who had been transferred to our specialized weaning centre due to prolonged mechanical ventilation ( > 14 days ) and weaning failure.
16039838,"Patients and participants : Out of 87 long - term survivors ( > 6 months ) , 73 patients ( mean age : 60.3 + / - 13.6 years , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD , 43 % ) , thoraco - restrictive ( 21 % ) or neuromuscular disorders ( 15 % ) , various chronic diseases ( 22 % ) ) returned the MOS 36 - Item Short - Form Health Status Survey ( SF - 36 ) and the St. George 's respiratory questionnaire ( SGRQ )."
16039838,Measurements and results : The total ventilation time was 38.7 + / - 45.9 days.
16039838,The time between discharge from ICU and HRQL assessment was 31.0 + / - 22.2 months.
16039838,"Physical health was markedly reduced compared to general population norm , but mental health was mildly impaired."
16039838,HRQL was comparable to patients with stable CRF receiving non-invasive ventilation who did not need prolonged invasive MV.
16039838,"In addition , general HRQL was better in patients with restrictive respiratory disease compared to patients with neuromuscular diseases ( P < 0.05 )."
16039838,Physiological parameters such as blood gases or lung function parameters were not correlated to any HRQL measurements.
16039838,"Conclusions : In patients with CRF surviving prolonged ventilation on ICU , the presence of CRF itself is the major determinant of HRQL."
16039838,"Here , the underlying cause of CRF is the major factor which determines the degree of HRQL impairment with patients suffering from restrictive ventilatory disorders reporting the best HRQL when compared to patients with COPD or neuromuscular diseases."
16039838,Despite severe physical handicaps due to CRF mental health is only mildly compromised.
7569338,Recent results of basic research on regulation of surfactant secretion and surfactant physiology not only in the alveolus but also in peripheral small airways allow the conclusion that disorders in surfactant homeostasis may contribute to the pathophysiology of airway obstruction and hyperinflation.
7569338,We therefore hypothesized that patients with respiratory failure due to obstructive lung disease may benefit from exogenous surfactant.
7569338,Here we report a case that indicates the clinical situation to be considered for treatment with exogenous surfactant.
7569338,The benefit for the patient was successful weaning from the ventilator.
7569338,"Improvements in effective compliance , resistance and blood gas parameters were observed following surfactant application."
31248954,Normal spirometry is often used to preclude airway disease in individuals with unspecific respiratory symptoms.
31248954,We tested the hypothesis that chronic respiratory symptoms are associated with respiratory hospitalisations and death in individuals with normal spirometry without known airway disease.We included 108 246 randomly chosen individuals aged 20 - 100 years from a Danish population - based cohort study.
31248954,Normal spirometry was defined as a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s / forced vital capacity ratio ≥ 0.70.
31248954,"Chronic respiratory symptoms included dyspnoea , chronic mucus hypersecretion , wheezing and cough."
31248954,"Individuals with known airway disease , i.e. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and / or asthma , were excluded ( n = 10 291 )."
31248954,"We assessed risk of hospitalisations due to exacerbations of airway disease and pneumonia , and respiratory and all - cause mortality , from 2003 through 2018.52 999 individuals had normal spirometry without chronic respiratory symptoms and 30 890 individuals had normal spirometry with chronic respiratory symptoms."
31248954,"During follow - up , we observed 1037 hospitalisations with exacerbation of airway disease , 5743 hospitalisations with pneumonia and 8750 deaths , of which 463 were due to respiratory disease."
31248954,"Compared with individuals with normal spirometry without chronic respiratory symptoms , multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for individuals with normal spirometry with chronic respiratory symptoms were 1.62 ( 95 % CI 1.20 - 2.18 ) for exacerbation hospitalisations , 1.26 ( 95 % CI 1.17 - 1.37 ) for pneumonia hospitalisations , 1.59 ( 95 % CI 1.22 - 2.06 ) for respiratory mortality and 1.19 ( 95 % CI 1.13 - 1.25 ) for all - cause mortality."
31248954,There was a positive dose - response relationship between number of symptoms and risk of outcomes.
31248954,"Results were similar after 2 years of follow - up , for never - smokers alone , and for each symptom separately.Chronic respiratory symptoms are associated with respiratory hospitalisations and death in individuals with normal spirometry without known airway disease."
9894539,"Background : The prevalence of chronic cough , chronic phlegm , dyspnea , and non-cold wheeze was estimated from a mixed - mode survey of Ohio cash grain farmers in 1993."
9894539,"Methods : Personal characteristics of the principal operators ( POs ) such as age and cigarette smoking , in addition to selected farm characteristics and relevant medical and work history factors potentially associated with both exposure to respiratory irritants and subsequent respiratory symptoms were considered."
9894539,"Results : The overall design - adjusted prevalences ( and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were : 9.4 % ( 7.6 - 11.1 % ) for chronic cough , 10.8 % ( 9.0 - 12.6 % ) for chronic phlegm , 16.2 % ( 14.1 - 18.3 % ) for dyspnea , and 8.1 % ( 6.4 - 9.8 % ) for non-cold wheeze."
9894539,"In univariate and multivariate analyses , smoking status was found , not surprisingly , to be the strongest predictor of increased symptom prevalence compared to all other factors."
9894539,"Other non-occupational factors found associated with increased symptom prevalence include age ( cough , phlegm , dyspnea ) and pet allergy ( non-cold wheeze )."
9894539,"Occupational factors found at least weakly associated with increased symptom prevalence include lifetime hours of cab tractor operation ( cough ) ; percent time spent farming ( phlegm ) ; having livestock other than cattle , cows , and calves ( dyspnea ) ; acres of corn for silage or green chop ( cough ) ; acres of alfalfa hay ( non-cold wheeze ) ; and personal involvement with pesticides ( cough )."
9894539,Conclusions : Symptom prevalences reported here are consistent with previous findings from studies of other groups of farmers.
9894539,Results pertaining to factors found associated with symptom prevalences should be interpreted in light of several sources of potential bias.
3792384,"Thirty - six infants and children presenting with recurrent respiratory disorders ( RRD ) as the sole clinical symptom including bronchial asthma ( 6 ) , recurrent obstructive bronchitis with or without wheezing ( 18 ) , chronic nocturnal cough ( 3 ) , recurrent episodes of pneumonia ( 3 ) , recurrent pharyngitis ( 3 ) and recurrent laryngitis ( 3 ) were investigated for associated gastro - oesophageal reflux ( GER ) by oesophagram , endoscopy and continuous 24 h pH monitoring of the distal oesophagus."
3792384,"The pH monitoring criteria were selected on the basis of a preliminary study comparing statistically measurements of 32 variables recorded in 15 patients who all had clinical , radiological and endoscopic evidence of GER and in 8 asymptomatic controls."
3792384,"Although patients with symptomatic GER differed significantly from the asymptomatic ones for 27 variables examined , 6 variables emerged as having the highest value for discrimination ( overlap score 0 - 1 )."
3792384,"Among these , the Euler - Byrne index ( number of reflux pH less than 4 + 4 times the number of reflux episodes of more than 5 min ) , the percentage of total reflux time and the number of reflux episodes 1 h post-cibal scored 0 ( no overlap )."
3792384,GER was considered to be present when at least five of these six parameters were abnormal.
3792384,The overall incidence of GER in children with RRD was 41 % ( 15 ) when detected by oesophagram and 61 % ( 22 ) when diagnosed by pH monitoring criteria.
3792384,"In the children with bronchial asthma or with recurrent laryngitis , the percentage of reflux time during sleep was about 40 times higher than in asymptomatic controls and 2 times higher than in those with symptomatic GER."

23727460,"Background : Pulmonary hemorrhage ( PH ) occurs in 2 - 5 % of SLE patients , and is associated with a high mortality rate ( 79 - 90 % )."
23727460,"Diagnostic criteria for this complication include : 1 ) Pulmonary infiltrates , with at least 3/4 of lung tissue involved in a chest x ray , 2 ) Acute respiratory failure , 3 ) A decrease of 3g / dL or more in hemoglobin levels."
23727460,"PH might lead to organized pneumonia , collagen deposition , and pulmonary fibrosis which in time might cause changes in pulmonary function tests with either restrictive or obstructive patterns."
23727460,Aim : To evaluate the existence of abnormalities in pulmonary function tests after a PH episode.
23727460,"Methods : We included patients with SLE and primary vasculitis that developed PH. During the acute episode , we measured SLEDAI in SLE patients , five factor score in microscopic polyangiitis ( MPA ) and Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Store ( BVAS ) in granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( GPA ) ( Wegener )."
23727460,"We determined the number of PH events , treatment , and ventilator assistance requirements and correlated its association with abnormal pulmonary function tests."
23727460,"Results : We included 10 patients , 7 with SLE , 2 with MPA and 1 with GPA ( Wegener )."
23727460,"The mean activity measures were : SLEDAI 20.4 ± 7.5 , FFS 2 , and BVAS 36."
23727460,"Treatment consisted in methylprednisolone ( MPD ) in 3 patients , MPD plus cyclophosphamide ( CY ) in 6 patients , and MPD , CY , IV immunoglobulin , and plasmapheresis in one patient."
23727460,Five patients required ventilatory support.
23727460,"We found abnormalities in pulmonary function tests in 8 patients , three had an obstructive pattern and five a restrictive pattern ; 2 patients did not show any change."
23727460,We did not find a significant association with any of the studied variables.
23727460,Conclusion : PH might cause abnormalities in pulmonary function tests and prolonged immunosuppressive treatment could be required.
23817677,"Background : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , once regarded as a disease of developed countries , is now recognised as a common disease in low - and middle - income countries."
23817677,No studies have been performed to examine how the community in resource poor settings of a rural area in sub-Saharan Africa lives with chronic respiratory symptoms.
23817677,"Aims : To explore beliefs and attitudes concerning health ( particularly respiratory illnesses ) , use of biomass fuels , tobacco smoking , and the use of health services."
23817677,"Methods : A qualitative study was undertaken in a rural area of Masindi district in Uganda , using focus group discussions with 10 - 15 members of the community in 10 randomly selected villages."
23817677,"Results : Respiratory symptoms were common among men , women , and children."
23817677,In several communities respiratory symptoms were stigmatised and often associated with tuberculosis.
23817677,Almost all the households used firewood for cooking and the majority cooked indoors without any ventilation.
23817677,"The extent of exposure to tobacco and biomass fuel smoke was largely determined by their cultural tradition and gender , tribal origin and socioeconomic factors."
23817677,"Many people were unaware of the damage to respiratory health caused by these risk factors , notably the disproportionate effect of biomass smoke in women and children."
23817677,"Conclusions : The knowledge of chronic respiratory diseases , particularly COPD , is poor in the rural community in sub-Saharan Africa."
23817677,The lack of knowledge has created different beliefs and attitudes concerning respiratory symptoms.
23817677,"Few people are aware of the relation between smoke and respiratory health , leading to extensive exposure to mostly biomass - related smoke."
8020264,"To determine whether chronic lower respiratory tract disorders contributed to the development of chronic mountain sickness ( CMS ) , we compared hemoglobin ( Hb ) , oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) , peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) , and CMS scores ( CMSsco ) in 97 normal men at high altitude with those of men at high altitude with acute ( ARD ; n = 12 ) , chronic upper ( CURD ; n = 33 ) , and chronic lower ( CLRD ; n = 34 ) respiratory diseases."
8020264,The clinical diagnosis of the different types of respiratory disorders was based on the results of a questionnaire and physical examination performed during an epidemiologic study.
8020264,"The CLRD group had higher CMSsco and Hb concentrations , and lower SaO2 and PEFR values when compared with the other groups."
8020264,The frequency of low PEFR and SaO2 and high Hb and CMSsco was substantially higher in men with CLRD when compared with normal subjects.
8020264,"The results support the hypothesis that there is an association between signs and symptoms of CMS , as measured by the CMSsco , and CLRD."
8020264,"The chronic hypoxemia , product of chronic lung diseases , would cause excessive erythrocytosis and increase the signs and symptoms of CMS."
8020264,"Studies of Hb , PEFR , pulse oximetry , and CMSsco are recommended for early detection of high - altitude natives at risk of developing CMS."
13714195,To investigate the high death rates for bronchitis in South Wales miners a survey of respiratory symptoms and ventilatory capacity in 90 % of a random sample of 600 men between the ages of 35 and 64 and 200 women between 55 and 64 living in the Rhondda Fach was carried out.
13714195,"The sample of men was stratified by age and occupation , 100 miners and ex-miners , and 100 non-miners being studied in each decade."
13714195,"The higher prevalence of symptoms and lower mean indirect maximum breathing capacity ( I.M.B.C. ) of the miners and ex-miners , observed previously , was confirmed and within the mining group there was little relation of symptoms to radiological category of pneumoconiosis."
13714195,Miners and ex-miners with progressive massive fibrosis had a lower mean I.M.B.C. than the rest at all ages.
13714195,Analysis of symptoms and I.M.B.C. by length of time spent working on the coal - getting shift in both miners and ex-miners did not suggest that the total dust dosage to which a man had been exposed during his working life was closely related to chronic respiratory disease.
13714195,A lower prevalence of symptoms and a higher mean indirect M.B.C. was found in those who had worked for under one year on the coal - getting shift.
13714195,Above one year no clear pattern of symptom prevalence was discerned although there was a slight downward trend in the mean indirect M.B.C. with increased time spent working on the coal - getting shift.
13714195,When working miners alone were considered the reduction in ventilatory function with increasing duration of work was slightly greater.
13714195,Dust exposure alone seemed unlikely to account for all the excess respiratory disease in miners compared with the rest of the community and other possible explanations are discussed.
13714195,The women recorded a lower prevalence of symptoms than the men who had never worked in mining.
13714195,"This prevalence was , however , higher than that previously found in rural areas in Wales and Scotland."
13714195,The mean indirect M.B.C. recorded for the women in this survey was also lower than that observed in Scots women.
13714195,"Analysis of the findings in the women according to the occupation of their husbands showed that miners ' wives recorded a higher prevalence of symptoms and lower mean indirect M.B.C. than non-miners ' wives , suggesting the importance of social rather than occupational factors in miners."
13714195,Smoking was associated with an increased prevalence of symptoms and lower indirect M.B.C. in the men but not in the women.
13714195,"Differnces in smoking habits could not , however , account for the differences between miners and non-miners , as these remained after standardization for smoking."
32648456,Background : Azithromycin is potential for preventing exacerbations in chronic respiratory diseases.
32648456,"However , rare attention was paid to the cough symptom of such airway diseases by azithromycin intervention."
32648456,We summarized the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in chronic respiratory diseases related cough.
32648456,"Methods : We searched 4 electronic databases ( PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane , and Web of Science ) to identify randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) comparing the change of Leicester Cough Questionnaire ( LCQ ) score , cough visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and side effects of azithromycin in patients of chronic respiratory diseases with cough."
32648456,Results : We identified 5 RCTs ( n = 879 patients ) in pooled analyses.
32648456,"Compared to placebo , azithromycin intervention had no effect in reducing cough [ mean difference ( MD ) 0.73 ; 95 % CI : -0.78 to 2.24 ; P = 0.34 ] with significant heterogeneity ( P = 0.03 , I2 = 71 % )."
32648456,"However , heterogeneity is caused by one study."
32648456,"After removal of this study , azithromycin administration had shown clinically important improvement in LCQ score ( MD 1.30 ; 95 % CI : 1.15 - 1.46 ; P < 0.00001 ; I2 = 0 % )."
32648456,"In addition , no significant difference was detected in adverse events and azithromycin administration probably had less central nervous system side effects for chronic respiratory diseases with cough."
32648456,Conclusions : The addition of oral azithromycin may result in significant benefit for chronic respiratory diseases related cough.
32648456,Azithromycin was safe for those patients with cough.
32421847,"Background : In case of dispersion of toxic industrial compounds ( TICs ) , patients with chronic respiratory diseases would be highly endangered , as they would be unable to use the standard - issue Chemical - Biological - Radio - Nuclear ( CBRN ) mask."
32421847,"Therefore , we defined guidelines to deliver the appropriate respiratory protection devices to this sub-population of patients."
32421847,"Methods : We used the Israel Ministry of Health Registry to analyze and define chronic respiratory disease patients , both hospitalized and at home , according to their ventilatory and supportive needs."
32421847,"We then identified the gaps in the current available protection measures , and performed a set of in vitro , in vivo , and human studies , aimed to validate the provided tailored solutions and to develop a flow chart and a set of guidelines to be used as requested."
32421847,Results : Chronic respiratory disease patients were subdivided into three distinct groups.
32421847,We found that standard oxygen and ventilator tubes do not compromise the protection factor afforded by standard protection hoods.
32421847,"We further developed a CBRN filter adaptor , enabling the use of standard - issued CBRN filter with all ventilators."
32421847,These experiments have led to the development of a flow chart and guidelines to allow both the Military and the Civil Health authorities dis - tributing the most appropriate respiratory protection devices to patients with chronic respiratory diseases.
32421847,"Conclusions : As TIC incidents occur mostly in fixed facilities , both local and national authorities can use our ap - proach in preparing for such an incident."
31129045,Background and objective : The management of symptoms in patients with advanced chronic respiratory diseases needs more attention.
31129045,This review summarizes the latest evidence on interventions to relieve dyspnoea in these patients.
31129045,"Methods : We searched randomised controlled trials , observational studies , systematic reviews , and meta - analyses published between 1990 and 2019 in English in PubMed data base using the keywords."
31129045,"Dyspnoea , Breathlessness AND : pharmacological and non pharmacological therapy , oxygen , non invasive ventilation , pulmonary rehabilitation , alternative medicine , intensive care , palliative care , integrated care , self - management."
31129045,"Studies on drugs ( e.g. bronchodilators ) or interventions ( e.g. lung volume reduction surgery , lung transplantation ) to manage underlying conditions and complications , or tools for relief of associated symptoms such as pain , are not addressed."
31129045,Results : Relief of dyspnoea has received relatively little attention in clinical practice and literature.
31129045,"Many pharmacological and non pharmacological therapies are available to relieve dyspnoea , and improve patients ' quality of life."
31129045,"There is a need for greater knowledge of the benefits and risks of these tools by doctors , patients and families to avoid unnecessary fears which might reduce or delay the delivery of appropriate care."
31129045,We need services for multidisciplinary care in early and late phases of diseases.
31129045,"Early integration of palliative care with respiratory , primary care , and rehabilitation services can help patients and caregivers."
31129045,Conclusion : Relief of dyspnoea as well as of any distressing symptom is a human right and an ethical duty for doctors and caregivers who have many potential resources to achieve this.
3921516,We have recently shown that background presence of chronic metabolic acid - base disorder markedly alters in vivo acute CO2 titration curve.
3921516,These studies were carried out to assess the influence of chronic respiratory acid - base disorders on response to acute hypercapnia and to explore whether the chronic level of plasma pH is the factor responsible for alterations in the CO2 titration curve.
3921516,We compared whole - body responses to acute hypercapnia of dogs with preexisting chronic respiratory alkalosis ( n = 8 ) with that of normal animals ( n = 4 ) and animals with chronic respiratory acidosis ( n = 13 ).
3921516,"Chronic respiratory alkalosis and acidosis , as well as the acute CO2 titrations , were produced in unanesthetized dogs within a large environmental chamber."
3921516,"For comparison with our data on chronic metabolic acidosis and alkalosis , plasma bicarbonate levels , which are secondarily altered in chronic respiratory acid - base disorders , were used as an index of chronic acid - base status of the animals."
3921516,"Results indicate that , as with chronic metabolic acid - base disorders , a larger increment in plasma bicarbonate occurs during acute hypercapnia when steady - state plasma bicarbonate is low ( respiratory alkalosis ) than when it is high ( respiratory acidosis )."
3921516,"Yet , in further analogy with the metabolic studies , plasma hydrogen ion concentration is better defended at higher plasma bicarbonate levels in accordance with mathematical relationships defined by the Henderson - Hasselbalch equation."
3921516,Combined results demonstrate that the influence of chronic acid - base status on whole - body response to acute hypercapnia is independent of initial plasma pH. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
31857556,Background : Cognitive impairment has emerged as an important concern in clinical practice in aging population.
31857556,Several comorbid factors contribute to etiopathogenesis ; one disease of interest is chronic respiratory disease.
31857556,Aim : The aim of this study is to investigate the association of chronic respiratory disease with risk of cognitive impairment in older Mexicans.
31857556,"Materials and methods : Data were obtained from 2782 Mexicans , aged ≥ 60 years , enrolled in waves I ( 2001 ) and III ( 2012 ) of the Mexican Health and Aging Study , a prospective cohort of nationally representative sample of older Mexicans."
31857556,Participants ' self - reported responses were used to categorize them into having respiratory disease or not.
31857556,"Study outcome included participants categorized into "" cognitively impaired "" or "" cognitively normal "" groups."
31857556,Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the relationship.
31857556,"Results : Overall , 16 % of cohort participants reported cognitively impaired at Wave III."
31857556,"Compared with older Mexicans without chronic respiratory disease diagnosis , those diagnosed were not significantly associated with risk of cognitive impairment [ adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) : 0.94 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.58 - 1.58 ]."
31857556,Conclusion : Chronic respiratory disease is not significantly associated with risk of cognitive impairment in older Mexican adults.
121348,"Thirty chronic hashish smokers ( mean age - 20 years ) with respiratory symptoms and six control subjects who were nonhashish smokers were evaluated by history , physical examination , bronchoscopy , and bronchial biopsy."
121348,"Twenty - three ( 23 ) of 23 ( 100 percent ) patients who smoked hashish plus cigarettes had one or more histopathologic abnormalities of basal cell hyperplasia , atypical cells , or squamous cell metaplasia."
121348,"Only one of seven ( 28.6 percent ) hashish smokers who smoked cigarettes , one of three ( 33.3 percent ) cigarette smokers who smoked no hashish , and zero of three ( 0 percent ) nonsmokers showed one or more of the same histopathologic lesions ( p less than .05 )."
121348,"Hashish smoking when combined with cigarette smoking appeared to have more deleterious pulmonary effects than either hashish or cigarettes smoked alone , and the abnormal histopathologic lesions found in these smokers are identical to those frequently associated with later development of emphysema and carcinoma of the lung."
3520185,Patients with COPD who develop acute respiratory failure require special attention in their management.
3520185,"Patients with severe COPD often have cor pulmonale , complex acid / base compensations , and altered respiratory control mechanisms."
3520185,These need to be considered when approaching the patient with an acute decompensation.
3520185,"Because of the improving prognosis in this group of patients , aggressive management should be undertaken using combinations of bronchodilator medications , oxygen , bronchial hygiene , and antibiotics."
17568873,Neuromuscular diseases affect alveolar air exchange and therefore cause chronic respiratory failure.
17568873,"The onset of respiratory failure can be acute , as in traumas , or progressive ( slow or rapid ) , as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , muscular dystrophies , diseases of the myoneural junction , etc.."
17568873,"Respiratory muscle impairment also affects cough efficiency and , according to the current knowledge regarding the type of treatment available in Brazil to these patients , it can be said that the high rates of morbidity and mortality in these individuals are more often related to the fact that they cough inefficiently rather than to the fact that they ventilate poorly."
17568873,"In this review , with the objective of presenting the options of devices available to support and substitute for natural ventilation in patients with neuromuscular diseases , we have compiled a brief history of the evolution of orthopedic braces and prostheses used to aid respiration since the end of the 19th century."
17568873,"In addition , we highlight the elements that are fundamental to the diagnosis of alveolar hypoventilation and of failure of the protective cough mechanism : taking of a clinical history ; determination of peak cough flow ; measurement of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures ; spirometry in two positions ( sitting and supine ) ; pulse oximetry ; capnography ; and polysomnography."
17568873,"Furthermore , the threshold values available in the literature for the use of nocturnal ventilatory support and for the extension of this support through the daytime period are presented."
17568873,"Moreover , the maneuvers used to increase cough efficiency , as well as the proper timing of their introduction , are discussed."
17136967,"The chronic respiratory questionnaire , available as an interviewer and a self - administered instrument , includes 20 items across four domains : dyspnea ( 5 items ) , fatigue ( 4 items ) , emotional function ( 7 items ) , and mastery ( 4 items )."
17136967,"When completing this instrument , patients rate their experience on a 7 - point scale ranging from 1 ( maximum impairment ) to 7 ( no impairment )."
17136967,The Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire has demonstrated excellent measurement properties for both discriminative and evaluative purposes and served as a model in numerous methodological studies in chronic airflow limitation and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
17136967,We performed a systematic review of the literature on the chronic respiratory questionnaire to summarize the key qualities of the chronic respiratory questionnaire and to appraise the work regarding the minimal important difference of the chronic respiratory questionnaire.
17136967,This paper includes a revision of our initial definition of the minimal important difference and a methodological framework for using anchor based approaches to establish the minimal important difference pioneered by Jaeschke and colleagues.
17136967,Other approaches to evaluate the minimal important difference include distribution - based methods and panel - based methods.
17136967,Investigators have used all of these approaches to establish the minimal important difference for the chronic respiratory questionnaire and the results are in general agreement with the minimal important difference of 0.5 for the mean domain scores of the chronic respiratory questionnaire.
17136967,"As a result of this literature review and discussion at the workshop , we established several research objectives."
17136967,These objectives include the exploration of presentation of quality of life information and prospective anchor - based approaches.
14401755,Mortality and morbidity statistics suggest that miners and foundryworkers are more prone to bronchitis than other industrial workers but it is not yet certain that this excess is due to occupational factors.
14401755,"The present investigation was designed to compare the prevalence of bronchitis and respiratory disability in a representative sample of miners , foundryworkers , and other industrial groups living in Staveley , Derbyshire , a town of some 18,000 inhabitants , and to study some of the possible aetiological factors."
14401755,"A random sample of 776 men , stratified by age into two groups , 25 to 34 and 55 to 64 years , and by occupation into four groups , non-dusty , miners and ex-miners , foundry and ex-foundryworkers , and other dusty jobs , was used."
14401755,Respiratory symptoms were recorded on a standardized questionnaire and the ventilatory capacity was assessed by means of the forced expiratory volume ( F.E.V. 0 · 75 ) and recorded as the indirect maximum breathing capacity ( M.B.C. ).
14401755,Miners and ex-miners recorded a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and a lower mean M.B.C. than men who had worked only in dust - free occupations.
14401755,In the older age group the differences were not large and were not statistically significant but in the younger men the difference in the mean M.B.C. was significant.
14401755,Foundry and ex-foundryworkers with a pure industrial history recorded a similar prevalence of symptoms to the men who had never worked in dusty occupations and their mean M.B.C. was only slightly and insignificantly lower.
14401755,"A higher prevalence of symptoms and a lower mean M.B.C. was , however , recorded by the foundrymen who had also been exposed to other dusts or fumes and the occupational histories suggested that such exposure was more likely than foundry work to account for the findings."
14401755,The number of years spent on the coal - getting shift was used to assess the importance of exposure to coal dust.
14401755,"In the elderly miners without pneumoconiosis there was a significant increase in the prevalence of breathlessness , accompanied by a reciprocal fall in the mean M.B.C. with increasing years spent on the coal - getting shift ; but in no other group was a consistent trend found."
14401755,In both age groups the prevalence of respiratory symptoms was lower and the mean M.B.C. higher in non-smokers than in smokers and ex-smokers.
14401755,Heavy smokers ( those smoking 15g.
14401755,"and over / day ) recorded a higher prevalence of symptoms and a lower mean M.B.C. than light smokers , and the values for ex-smokers approximated to those of the non-smokers."
14401755,The wives of the elderly men in the sample were studied to try to determine how far the apparently high rates of bronchitis shown by national mortality statistics are attributable to social factors.
14401755,The findings suggested that the wives of the men who worked in dusty jobs had a somewhat higher prevalence of cough and / or sputum and of chest illness during the past three years than the wives of those who had worked only in dust - free occupations.
16636330,"Sedentary lifestyles and increased pollution brought about by industrialization pose major challenges to the prevention of both obesity and chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , asthma , obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome."
16636330,"Obesity has emerged as an important risk factor for these respiratory diseases , and in many instances weight loss is associated with important symptomatic improvement."
16636330,"Moreover , obesity may influence the development and presentation of these diseases."
16636330,"In this article , we review the current understanding of the influence of obesity on chronic respiratory diseases and the clinical management of obesity concurrent with asthma , COPD , obstructive sleep apnea or obesity hypoventilation syndrome."
9363125,Clinically significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common and important disorder in the United States.
9363125,"As many as 15 million individuals suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , many of whom have disease requiring hospital or ICU admission."
9363125,Acute respiratory failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the most common causes of admission to the ICU for this patient population.
9363125,In this article I address common issues regarding diagnosis and management of acute respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
9363125,Acute respiratory failure will be defined as well as the common and unusual etiologies of acute respiratory failure.
9363125,"Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment will be addressed , especially the ventilatory treatment of the intubated patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
9363125,Special attention has been made to included the most recent investigations regarding diagnosis and treatment of the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory failure.
7995407,The search for improved quality of life and a reduction in health care costs is leading to the development of home treatment.
7995407,The organization of home treatment for chronic respiratory patients in 13 European countries was evaluated at the end of 1992 by means of a questionnaire.
7995407,"Switzerland and the Association Nationale pour le Traitement A Domicile de l'Insuffisance Respiratoire Chronique ( ANTADIR ) in France maintain registers for patients on oxygen therapy , mechanical ventilation and sleep disorders."
7995407,Sweden and Poland have a national register for patients receiving oxygen.
7995407,"In other countries , some information can be obtained from the National Health Service or the commercial provider."
7995407,"Oxygen concentrators are used preferentially in all countries except Italy , Denmark , Spain and The Netherlands."
7995407,Home ventilator treatment is generally performed by volume - cycled ventilators.
7995407,"National prescription rules exist in some parts of Spain , Switzerland and Belgium."
7995407,"In other countries , such as Germany , prescriptions rely on recommendations elaborated by specialists or international guidelines."
7995407,"Service and equipment are provided by national organizations , health services , commercial companies or hospitals."
7995407,Home supervision of the patient is performed by a nurse and / or a doctor and equipment maintenance by a technician.
7995407,Important differences exist between countries in Europe in home treatment of chronic respiratory disease.
7995407,Comparative analysis should help achieve uniform standards and provide a basis for future research.
7509054,"To assess whether underlying diagnosis affects morbidity and mortality outcomes in patients with chronic respiratory failure , we studied 55 patients with chronic respiratory failure of infancy and childhood ( CRFIC )."
7509054,Entry criteria included patients with chronic respiratory failure due to static neurologic or neuromuscular conditions or secondary to other disease processes considered likely to improve or resolve over time.
7509054,"Subjects were grouped into those having chronic lung disease ( CLD , n = 22 ) , neurologic or neuromuscular diseases ( NM , n = 21 ) , or congenital abnormalities affecting the respiratory system ( CA , n = 12 )."
7509054,The average duration of follow - up was 21.3 months.
7509054,There were no differences between groups in mortality with only four deaths ( 7 % ).
7509054,"Patients with CLD fared better than those with NM or CA in duration of ventilatory support , duration of tracheostomy , percentage of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation , and neurodevelopmental outcomes."
7509054,"Subjects with CLD had a significantly greater frequency of tracheomalacia ( 86 % ) , feeding disorders ( 86 % ) , and hypogammaglobulinemia G ( 77 % )."
7509054,There were no differences between groups for respiratory readmissions or family dysfunction.
7509054,"We conclude that almost all patients with CRFIC will survive , but morbidity outcomes will vary based on the underlying diagnosis."
9770263,Sleep - disordered breathing is ubiquitous in COPD.
9770263,"Sleep - related hypoxemia results from hypoventilation attributable to reduced respiratory drive and abnormal mechanics , and from probable changes in V / Q matching."
9770263,An overlap syndrome combining COPD and OSA also has been described.
9770263,"Disturbances in cardiac , hematologic , and pulmonary function , as well as sleep complaints , are common when COPD is complicated by nocturnal hypoxemia , and these sequelae are even more common when COPD and OSA coexist."
9770263,"Treatment with oxygen is the mainstay for COPD and sleep desaturation alone , whereas combined nasal CPAP and oxygen are most frequently used for the overlap syndrome."
31795618,"Objectives : In recent years , transboundary air pollution from mainland East Asia has led to growing concerns about air pollution in Japan."
31795618,Air pollution is reportedly associated with the exacerbation of respiratory diseases.
31795618,"In this study , we assessed the effects of air pollution on respiratory symptoms and the health status of participants with and without chronic respiratory diseases."
31795618,Methods : Participants ( n = 2753 ) with and without chronic respiratory diseases who visited healthcare facilities in Japan during February from 2010 to 2015 filled out a self - report questionnaire regarding their symptoms and perceived health status.
31795618,Participants were followed up during April - May and June - July.
31795618,"Results : Oxidant concentrations were associated with respiratory symptoms , overall health , and quality of life ( QoL )."
31795618,Suspended particulate matter ( SPM ) and particulate matter < 2.5 μm levels were associated with physical fitness ; SPM was also associated with QoL.
31795618,"Recent experience of an Asian sand dust event had a significant effect on allergic symptoms , change in health , and QoL."
31795618,Conclusions : Respiratory symptoms were more strongly affected by oxidants than by other pollutants.
31795618,"Significant associations of air pollutants were found with a comprehensive range of items related to perceived health status , including overall health and QoL."
31795618,"Although the effects of air pollutants on respiratory symptoms and health status were more apparent among patients with respiratory diseases , the adverse effects of air pollutants were significant even among participants without such conditions."
28438369,Background : Respiratory instability in chronic heart failure ( CHF ) is characterized by irregularly rapid respiration or non-periodic breathing rather than by Cheyne - Stokes respiration.
28438369,We developed a new quantitative measure of respiratory instability ( RSI ) and examined its independent prognostic impact upon CHF.
28438369,"Methods : In 87 patients with stable CHF , respiratory flow and muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA ) were simultaneously recorded."
28438369,RSI was calculated from the frequency distribution of respiratory spectral components and very low frequency components.
28438369,"Results : During a mean follow - up of 85 ± 38 months , 24 patients died."
28438369,"Sixteen patients who died of cardiac causes had a lower RSI ( 16 ± 6 vs. 30 ± 21 , p < 0.01 ) , a lower specific activity scale ( 4.3 ± 1.4 Mets vs. 5.7 ± 1.4 Mets , p < 0.005 ) , a higher MSNA burst area ( 16 ± 5 % vs. 11 ± 4 % , p < 0.001 ) , and a higher brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) level ( 514 ± 559pg / ml vs. 234 ± 311pg / ml , p < 0.05 ) than 71 patients who did not die of cardiac causes."
28438369,"Multivariate analysis revealed that RSI ( p = 0.015 ) , followed by MSNA burst area ( p = 0.033 ) , was an independent predictor of subsequent all - cause deaths and that RSI ( p = 0.026 ) , MSNA burst area ( p = 0.001 ) , and BNP ( p = 0.048 ) were independent predictors of cardiac deaths."
28438369,Patients at very high risk of fatal outcome could be identified by an RSI < 20.
28438369,Conclusions : The daytime respiratory instability quantified by a new measure of RSI has prognostic importance independent of sympathetic nerve activation in patients with clinically stable CHF.
28438369,An RSI of < 20 identifies patients at very high risk for subsequent all - cause and cardiovascular death.
11982843,"Background : Advances in paediatric intensive care have reduced mortality but , unfortunately , one of the consequences is an increase in the number of patients with chronic diseases."
11982843,It is generally agreed that home care of children requiring ventilatory support improves their outcomes and results in cost saving for the National Health Service.
11982843,"Methods : Since 1985 , the Children 's Hospital Bambino Gesù of Rome has developed a program of paediatric home care."
11982843,The program is performed by a committed Home Health Care Team ( HHCT ) which selects the eligible patients for home care and trains the families to treat their child.
11982843,"During the period January 1985 to January 2001 , 53 children with chronic respiratory failure were included in the home care program."
11982843,"Of these , seven patients were successively excluded and six died in our intensive care unit ( ICU ) , while one still lives in our ICU since 1997."
11982843,The results obtained in the remaining 46 children are reported.
11982843,"Results : The pathologies consisted of disorders of respiratory control related to brain damage ( 26 % ) , upper airways obstructive disease ( 26 % ) , spinal muscular atrophy ( 22 % ) , myopathies and muscular dystrophies ( 6.5 % ) , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( 6.5 % ) , tracheomalacia ( 6.5 % ) , central hypoventilation syndrome ( 4.3 % ) and progressive congenital scoliosis ( 2.2 % )."
11982843,"Of these 46 patients , 34 children are mechanically ventilated and the median of their ICU stay was 109.5 days ( range 54 - 214 days ) , while the remaining 12 children were breathing spontaneously and the median of their ICU stay was 90.5 days ( range 61 - 134 days )."
11982843,"We temporarily readmitted six patients to our ICU to perform scheduled otolaryngological surgery , eight patients for acute respiratory infections and two patients for deterioration of their neurological status due to high pressure hydrocephalus for placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt ; these 16 patients were discharged back home again."
11982843,"Two other patients were readmitted for deterioration of their chronic disease and died in our ICU , while seven patients died at home."
11982843,Conclusions : Thirty - seven children are still alive at home and four of them improved their respiratory condition so that it was possible to remove the tracheostomy tube.
11982843,Our oldest patient has now achieved 15 years of mechanical ventilation at home.
31554703,COPD and obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) are highly prevalent and different clinical COPD phenotypes that influence the likelihood of comorbid OSA.
31554703,The increased lung volumes and low body mass index ( BMI ) associated with the predominant emphysema phenotype protects against OSA whereas the peripheral oedema and higher BMI often associated with the predominant chronic bronchitis phenotype promote OSA.
31554703,The diagnosis of OSA in COPD patients requires clinical awareness and screening questionnaires which may help identify patients for overnight study.
31554703,Management of OSA - COPD overlap patients differs from COPD alone and the survival of overlap patients treated with nocturnal positive airway pressure is superior to those untreated.
31554703,Sleep - related hypoventilation is common in neuromuscular disease and skeletal disorders because of the effects of normal sleep on ventilation and additional challenges imposed by the underlying disorders.
31554703,Hypoventilation is first seen during rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep before progressing to involve non-REM sleep and wakefulness.
31554703,Clinical presentation is nonspecific and daytime respiratory function measures poorly predict nocturnal hypoventilation.
31554703,Monitoring of respiration and carbon dioxide levels during sleep should be incorporated in the evaluation of high - risk patient populations and treatment with noninvasive ventilation improves outcomes.
27818024,"Dyspnoea is a complex , highly personalized and multidimensional sensory experience , and its underlying cause and mechanisms are still being investigated."
27818024,"Exertional dyspnoea is one of the most frequently encountered symptoms of patients with cardiopulmonary diseases , and is a common reason for seeking medical help."
27818024,"As the symptom usually progresses with the underlying disease , it can lead to an avoidance of physical activity , peripheral muscle deconditioning and decreased quality of life."
27818024,"Dyspnoea is closely associated with quality of life , exercise ( in ) tolerance and prognosis in various conditions , including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , heart failure , interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension , and is therefore an important therapeutic target."
27818024,"Effective management and treatment of dyspnoea is an important challenge for caregivers , and therapeutic options that attempt to reverse its underlying cause have been only partially successful This "" review "" will attempt to shed light on the physiological mechanisms underlying dyspnoea during exercise and to translate / apply them to a broad clinical spectrum of cardio - respiratory disorders."
32966334,"Background : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and asthma exacerbations are associated with ill health , increased mortality , and health care costs."
32966334,"However , there is limited evidence regarding mortality and its predictors among patients treated for COPD and asthma exacerbations in low - income nations , particularly in Ethiopia."
32966334,"Methods : A-6 month prospective observational study was conducted from April 20 - September 20 , 2019."
32966334,"Data were collected on socio - demographic , baseline clinical characteristics and outcomes of asthma and COPD exacerbations."
32966334,Data were entered into Epi - Data version 4.02.01 for cleaning and exported to STATA 14.0 for analysis.
32966334,Kaplan - Meier ( Log - rank test ) was used to compare the baseline survival experience of the study participants and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors of mortality.
32966334,Adjusted hazard ratios ( AHRs ) with two - sided p - value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
32966334,Results : A total of 130 patients ( 60 % males ) were included.
32966334,The median ( interquartile range ( IQR ) ) age of the study participants was 59 ( 50 - 70 ) years.
32966334,The median ( IQR ) survival time to death was 17.5 ( 10 - 26 ) days.
32966334,"The total proportion of in - hospital mortality was 10.78 % ( 14/130 ) , and the incidence rate of mortality was 2.56 per 1000 person - years."
32966334,"The duration of oxygen therapy ≥ 16hours / day ( AHR = 6.330 , 95 % CI [ 1.092 - 36.679 ] , and old age ( AHR = 1.066 , 95 % CI [ 1.0001 - 1.136 ] were the independent predictors of in - hospital mortality."
32966334,"Conclusion : In this study , the in - hospital mortality rate was very high."
32966334,"Moreover , prolonged oxygen therapy ( ≥ 16hours / day ) and old age were independently associated with in - hospital mortality."
32966334,"Therefore , special attention should be given to recipients of prolonged oxygen therapy and the elderly during hospital stay."
11800065,"Genetic , environmental , and metabolic risk factors are interrelated and contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus."
11800065,"A strong family history of diabetes mellitus , age , obesity , and physical inactivity identify those individuals at highest risk."
11800065,"Minority populations are also at higher risk , not only because of family history and genetics , but also because of adaptation to American environmental influences of poor dietary and exercise habits."
11800065,Women with a history of gestational diabetes as well as their children are at greater risk for progressing to type 2 diabetes mellitus.
11800065,Insulin resistance increases a person 's risk for developing impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.
11800065,Individuals who have insulin resistance share many of the same risk factors as those with type 2 diabetes.
11800065,"These include hyperinsulinemia , atherogenic dyslipidemia , glucose intolerance , hypertension , prothrombic state , hyperuricemia , and polycystic ovary syndrome."
11800065,Current interventions for the prevention and retardation of type 2 diabetes mellitus are those targeted towards modifying environmental risk factors such as reducing obesity and promoting physical activity.
11800065,"Awareness of risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes will promote screening , early detection , and treatment in high - risk populations with the goal of decreasing both microvascular and macrovascular complications."
29412061,The epidemic of Type 2 diabetes mellitus necessitates development of novel therapeutic and preventative strategies to attenuate expansion of this debilitating disease.
29412061,Evidence links the circadian system to various aspects of diabetes pathophysiology and treatment.
29412061,The aim of this review will be to outline the rationale for therapeutic targeting of the circadian system in the treatment and prevention of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and consequent metabolic comorbidities.
30409037,The global prevalence of diabetes has risen in adults from 4.7 % in 1980 to 8.5 % in 2014.
30409037,90 - 95 % of adults with diabetes have Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ).
30409037,This paper focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of T2D patients who have or are at risk for cardiovascular disease.
30409037,"Hyperglycemia , insulin resistance and excess fatty acids increase oxidative stress , disrupt protein kinase C signaling and increase advanced glycation end - products that result in vascular inflammation , vasoconstriction , thrombosis and atherogenesis."
30409037,Intensive T2D treatment produces a ≥ 10 % risk reduction in major macrovascular and microvascular events.
30409037,Glucose - lowering therapies must be individualized.
30409037,Metformin is an optimal drug for monotherapy.
30409037,"If hemoglobin A1c is not at goal , a sodium - glucose cotransporter - 2 inhibitor or a dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor should be considered for therapy with metformin."
30409037,Coronary angioplasty / stenting is recommended for diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarctions.
30409037,Coronary artery bypass grafting is recommended for symptomatic diabetic patients with multivessel disease.
27622231,"Background : The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) in children and adolescents is increasing , mirroring the epidemic of paediatric obesity."
27622231,Early - onset T2DM is associated with poor long - term outcomes.
27622231,"Objective : In this article , we describe the growing problem of early - onset T2DM in Australia , explore the difference between early - onset and adult - onset T2DM , and review the management of T2DM in children and adolescents."
27622231,Discussion : T2DM is difficult to differentiate from the more common type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) in the paediatric population.
27622231,"Risk factors for T2DM include obesity , ethnicity and family history , and adolescence is a predisposing time for the development of T2DM due to physiological insulin resistance."
27622231,"Early - onset T2DM is more associated with shorter duration to insulin requirement , development of diabetic complications and cardiovascular disease than adult - onset T2DM and T1DM."
27622231,"The main goals in management include normalising hyperglycaemia , facilitating lifestyle modifications and managing diabetes - related and obesity - related comorbidities."
27159875,The steep rise of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and associated complications go along with mounting evidence of clinically important sex and gender differences.
27159875,"T2DM is more frequently diagnosed at lower age and body mass index in men ; however , the most prominent risk factor , which is obesity , is more common in women."
27159875,"Generally , large sex - ratio differences across countries are observed."
27159875,"Diversities in biology , culture , lifestyle , environment , and socioeconomic status impact differences between males and females in predisposition , development , and clinical presentation."
27159875,"Genetic effects and epigenetic mechanisms , nutritional factors and sedentary lifestyle affect risk and complications differently in both sexes."
27159875,"Furthermore , sex hormones have a great impact on energy metabolism , body composition , vascular function , and inflammatory responses."
27159875,"Thus , endocrine imbalances relate to unfavorable cardiometabolic traits , observable in women with androgen excess or men with hypogonadism."
27159875,Both biological and psychosocial factors are responsible for sex and gender differences in diabetes risk and outcome.
27159875,"Overall , psychosocial stress appears to have greater impact on women rather than on men."
27159875,"In addition , women have greater increases of cardiovascular risk , myocardial infarction , and stroke mortality than men , compared with nondiabetic subjects."
27159875,"However , when dialysis therapy is initiated , mortality is comparable in both males and females."
27159875,Diabetes appears to attenuate the protective effect of the female sex in the development of cardiac diseases and nephropathy.
27159875,Endocrine and behavioral factors are involved in gender inequalities and affect the outcome.
27159875,More research regarding sex - dimorphic pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM and its complications could contribute to more personalized diabetes care in the future and would thus promote more awareness in terms of sex - and gender - specific risk factors.
28728958,Background : Physical exercise has been used to mitigate the metabolic effects of diabetes mellitus.
28728958,Objective : To evaluate the effect of resistance exercise when compared to aerobic exercise without insulin therapy on metabolic and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
28728958,"Methods : Papers were searched on the databases MEDLINE / PubMed , CINAHL , SPORTDiscus , LILACS , and SCIELO , without language or date of publication limits."
28728958,Clinical trials that compared resistance exercise to aerobic exercise in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who did not use insulin therapy were included.
28728958,"The quality of evidence and risk of bias were assessed using the GRADE system and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool , respectively."
28728958,"Meta - analysis was also used , whenever possible."
28728958,Two reviewers extracted the data independently.
28728958,"Eight eligible articles were included in this study , with a total of 336 individuals , with a mean age of 48 - 58 years."
28728958,"The protocols of aerobic and resistance exercise varied in duration from eight to 22 weeks , 30 - 60min / day , three to five times / week."
28728958,"Results : Overall the available evidence came from a very low quality of evidence and there was an increase in Maximal oxygen consumption ( mean difference : -2.86 ; 95 % CI : -3.90 to -1.81 ; random effect ) for the resistance exercise and no difference was found in Glycated hemoglobin , Body mass index , High - density lipoprotein cholesterol , Low - density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglycerides , and total cholesterol."
28728958,Conclusions : Resistance exercise appears to be more effective in promoting an increase in Maximal oxygen consumption in protocols longer than 12 weeks and there is no difference in the control of glycemic and lipid levels between the two types of exercise.
25824591,Macrovascular and microvascular complications that accompany Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) add to the burden among patients.
25824591,"The purpose of this systematic review is to conduct a comprehensive search of the medical literature investigating the prevalence of cardiovascular ( CV ) complications and assess their impact on healthcare costs , quality of life and mortality among patients with T2DM in the context of microvascular complications."
25824591,A total of 76 studies and reports were used in this systematic review.
25824591,Hypertension was the most prevalent complication among patients with T2DM.
25824591,The additional cost burden due to CV complications was higher than any other complication except end - stage renal disease.
25824591,"Quality of life was much lower among patients with CV complications and T2DM , and mortality was higher than either illness alone."
25867358,There is currently no reported staging system for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
25867358,"Here , I attempted to stage type 2 diabetes mellitus in order to help clinicians , patients , and other interested individuals to effectively evaluate patient conditions."
27262256,"This review article explores scientists ' current understanding of type 2 diabetes as a complex disorder that involves not just the pancreas and insulin system but also the liver , kidneys , gut , muscle , fat cells , and even the brain."
27262256,An appreciation of the complex pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes allows the primary care practitioner to best manage patients with this common and serious disorder.
31247468,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is a common clinical chronic disease , while its pathogenesis is still inconclusive."
31247468,"Intestinal flora , the largest micro-ecological system in the human body , is involved in , meanwhile has a major impact on the body 's material and energy metabolism."
31247468,"Recent studies have shown that in addition to obesity , genetics , and islet dysfunction , the disturbance of intestinal flora may partly give rise to diabetes."
31247468,"In this paper , we summarized the current research on the correlation between T2DM and intestinal flora , and concluded the pathological mechanisms of intestinal flora involved in T2DM."
31247468,"Moreover , the ideas and methods of prevention and treatment of T2DM based on intestinal flora were proposed , providing theoretical basis and literature reference for the treatment of T2DM and its complications based on the regulation of intestinal flora."
27974926,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex , chronic metabolic disease , presents a heterogeneous etiology , with risk factors at the social level and behavioral , environmental , and genetic susceptibility."
27974926,"It is associated with serious complications , but the early diagnosis and initiation of therapy may prevent or delay the onset of long - term complications."
27974926,"In children and adolescents , it was observed in particular increasing the prevalence of T2DM along with obesity , which is associated with insulin resistance."
27974926,Patient and family education for a young person with T2DM is very important and will focus on behavioral changes ( diet and activity ).
30515958,Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is a chronic disease that has reached the levels of a global epidemic.
30515958,"In order to achieve optimal glucose control , it is often necessary to rely on combination therapy of multiple drugs or insulin because uncontrolled glucose levels result in T2DM progression and enhanced risk of complications and mortality."
30515958,"Several antihyperglycemic agents have been developed over time , and T2DM pharmacotherapy should be prescribed based on suitability for the individual patient 's characteristics."
30515958,"Pharmacogenetics is the branch of genetics that investigates how our genome influences individual responses to drugs , therapeutic outcomes , and incidence of adverse effects."
30515958,"In this review , we evaluated the pharmacogenetic evidences currently available in the literature , and we identified the top informative genetic variants associated with response to the most common anti-diabetic drugs : metformin , DPP - 4 inhibitors / GLP1R agonists , thiazolidinediones , and sulfonylureas / meglitinides."
30515958,"Overall , we found 40 polymorphisms for each drug class in a total of 71 loci , and we examined the possibility of encouraging genetic screening of these variants / loci in order to critically implement decision - making about the therapeutic approach through precision medicine strategies."
30515958,"It is possible then to anticipate that when the clinical practice will take advantage of the genetic information of the diabetic patients , this will provide a useful resource for the prevention of T2DM progression , enabling the identification of the precise drug that is most likely to be effective and safe for each patient and the reduction of the economic impact on a global scale."
25249787,Type 2 diabetes is a serious and common chronic disease resulting from a complex inheritance - environment interaction along with other risk factors such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle.
25249787,"Type 2 diabetes and its complications constitute a major worldwide public health problem , affecting almost all populations in both developed and developing countries with high rates of diabetes - related morbidity and mortality."
25249787,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing exponentially , and a high prevalence rate has been observed in developing countries and in populations undergoing "" westernization "" or modernization."
25249787,"Multiple risk factors of diabetes , delayed diagnosis until micro - and macro-vascular complications arise , life - threatening complications , failure of the current therapies , and financial costs for the treatment of this disease , make it necessary to develop new efficient therapy strategies and appropriate prevention measures for the control of type 2 diabetes."
25249787,"Herein , we summarize our current understanding about the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes , the roles of genes , lifestyle and other factors contributing to rapid increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes."

31500825,"Background : The prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , representing > 90 % of all cases of diabetes , are increasing rapidly worldwide."
31500825,Identification of individuals at high risk of developing diabetes is of great importance as early interventions might delay or even prevent full - blown disease.
31500825,T2D is a complex disease caused by multiple genetic loci in interplay with lifestyle and environmental factors.
31500825,Recently over 400 distinct association signals were published ; these explain 18 % of the risk of T2D.
31500825,"Scope of review : In this review there is a major focus on risk factors and genetic and non-genetic biomarkers for the risk of T2D identified especially in large prospective population - based studies , and studies testing causality of the biomarkers for T2D in Mendelian randomization studies."
31500825,Another focus is on understanding genome - phenome interplay in the classification of individuals with T2D into subgroups.
31500825,Major conclusions : Several recent large population - based studies and their meta - analyses have identified multiple potential genetic and non-genetic biomarkers for the risk of T2D.
31500825,"Combination of genetic variants and physiologically characterized pathways improves the classification of individuals with T2D into subgroups , and is also paving the way to a precision medicine approach , in T2D."
28460155,"Oxidative stress has been considered as a major hallmark for the pathogenesis and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , but still it is debatable whether it is a mere aggregation of inflammatory - induced responses or clinical entity that underlies with various pathophysiological factors."
28460155,"In this regard , the latest studies have shown the increasing trends for the involvement of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis and development of T2DM."
28460155,ROS are highly reactive species and almost all cellular components are chemically changed due to the influence of ROS that ultimately results in the production of lipid peroxidation.
28460155,Lipid peroxidation is a major causative factor for the development of oxidative stress that leads to overt T2DM and its associated micro - and macro-vascular complications.
28460155,"In this article , we have briefly described the role of various causative factors , transcriptional and metabolic pathways which are responsible to increase the production of oxidative stress , a most pivotal factor for the pathogenesis and development of T2DM."
28460155,"Therefore , we conclude that measurement of oxidative stress biomarkers may be one of the optional tool for the diagnosis and prediction of T2DM."
28460155,"Moreover , the key findings described in this article also provides a new conceptual framework for forthcoming investigations on the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of T2DM and drug discovery."

30046957,Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is one of the common endocrinology diseases that greatly affects the health care sector and economy.
30046957,Application of hypoglycemic drugs has its own drawbacks and the use of non-drug therapy on treating T2DM has drawn much attention recently.
30046957,"This paper reviewed the research development of the non-pharmacological interventions on T2DM in recent years , including dietary therapy , exercise therapy , psychotherapy , acupuncture and moxibustion therapies and so on."
30046957,The authors mentioned the problems in the research of non-drug treatment for blood glucose control of T2DM and put forward new ideas for the research in the future.
30046957,Further well - designed trials with large sample size and long - term follow - up are needed to confirm current conclusions.
21115758,"Although physical activity ( PA ) is a key element in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes , many with this chronic disease do not become or remain regularly active."
21115758,"High - quality studies establishing the importance of exercise and fitness in diabetes were lacking until recently , but it is now well established that participation in regular PA improves blood glucose control and can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes , along with positively affecting lipids , blood pressure , cardiovascular events , mortality , and quality of life."
21115758,Structured interventions combining PA and modest weight loss have been shown to lower type 2 diabetes risk by up to 58 % in high - risk populations.
21115758,"Most benefits of PA on diabetes management are realized through acute and chronic improvements in insulin action , accomplished with both aerobic and resistance training."
21115758,"The benefits of physical training are discussed , along with recommendations for varying activities , PA - associated blood glucose management , diabetes prevention , gestational diabetes mellitus , and safe and effective practices for PA with diabetes - related complications."
30632770,Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) has become one of the most prevalent diseases on earth and several treatments have been developed.
30632770,"However , the current intervention approaches have not been as effective as expected."
30632770,One promising supplementary strategy is the use of probiotics through direct or indirect approaches.
30632770,Probiotics are microbial food cultures conferring health - promoting properties.
30632770,"In this review , we summarized the current theories and mechanisms of T2DM intervention using probiotics and hypothesize that probiotics intervene T2DM during its onsetting , developing , and complicating."
30632770,"For the first time , we comprehensively analyzed T2DM intervention in animal models using both wide - type probiotics in different forms and using recombinant probiotics."
30632770,"Then , probiotic intervention in T2DM patients was reviewed and the main results were compared with that obtained from animal studies."
30632770,"Finally yet importantly , remaining questions that are important such as in which form and in which state , as well as the future potential of probiotic intervention in T2DM were discussed from a perspective of food microbiologists."
30632770,"In conclusion , probiotic intervention in T2DM is promising but there are still many important issues unsolved yet."
30632770,"Critical review of the advances , questions , and potential of probiotic intervention in T2DM promotes the development of this approach for further application in humans."
31901868,A substantial body of literature has provided evidence for the role of gut microbiota in metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes.
31901868,"However , reports vary regarding the association of particular taxonomic groups with disease."
31901868,"In this systematic review , we focused on the potential role of different bacterial taxa affecting diabetes."
31901868,"We have summarized evidence from 42 human studies reporting microbial associations with disease , and have identified supporting preclinical studies or clinical trials using treatments with probiotics."
31901868,"Among the commonly reported findings , the genera of Bifidobacterium , Bacteroides , Faecalibacterium , Akkermansia and Roseburia were negatively associated with T2D , while the genera of Ruminococcus , Fusobacterium , and Blautia were positively associated with T2D."
31901868,We also discussed potential molecular mechanisms of microbiota effects in the onset and progression of T2D.
29699867,"The study of type 2 diabetes has been driven by advances in human genetics , epigenetics , biomarkers , mechanistic studies , and large clinical trials , enabling new insights into disease susceptibility , pathophysiology , progression , and development of complications."
29699867,"Simultaneously , several new drug classes with different mechanisms of action have been introduced over the past two decades , accompanied by data about cardiovascular safety and non-glycaemic outcomes."
29699867,"In this Review , we critically examine the progress and integration of this new science into clinical practice , and review opportunities for enabling the use of precision medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes."
29699867,"We contrast the success in delivering personalised medicine for monogenic diabetes with the greater challenge of providing a precision medicine approach for type 2 diabetes , highlighting gaps , limitations , and areas requiring further study."
28282717,Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is recognized as a public health problem and increasingly prevalent illness.
28282717,"Key elements of the guideline for diabetes care are based on evidence - based medicine approach and apply for population , not individuals."
28282717,"However , individualized care can improve diabetes management."
28282717,"Personalized medicine is otherwise called precision medicine tries to find better prediction , prevention , and intervention for T2DM individuals."
28282717,Precision medicine in diabetes refers to the utility of genomics data of a patient with diabetes to provide the most effective diagnosis strategies and treatment plans.
28282717,Over 100 genetic loci influence susceptibility to T2DM.
28282717,"Genomics data together with the potential of other "" Omics "" and clinical evidence - based data will lead to diabetes care improvement in the context of personalized medicine in the near future."
28282717,Breakthrough of technologies enables much greater improvements in the understanding of individual variations that may alter the T2DM outcome.
28282717,This article represents a comprehensive review of current knowledge on the impact of personalized medicine in T2DM.
29395440,Epidemiological studies have implied that diabetes mellitus ( DM ) will become an epidemic accompany with metabolic and endocrine disorders worldwide.
29395440,Most of DM patients are affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) with insulin resistance and insulin secretion defect.
29395440,"Generally , the strategies to treat T2DM are diet control , moderate exercise , hypoglycemic and lipid - lowing agents."
29395440,"Despite the therapeutic benefits for the treatment of T2DM , most of the drugs can produce some undesirable side effects."
29395440,"Considering the pathogenesis of T2DM , natural products ( NPs ) have become the important resources of bioactive agents for anti-T2DM drug discovery."
29395440,"Recently , more and more natural components have been elucidated to possess anti-T2DM properties , and many efforts have been carried out to elucidate the possible mechanisms."
29395440,The aim of this paper was to overview the activities and underlying mechanisms of NPs against T2DM.
29395440,Developments of anti-T2DM agents will be greatly promoted with the increasing comprehensions of NPs for their multiple regulating effects on various targets and signal pathways.
29914779,Type 2 diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent in older adults ( ≥ 65 years of age ) and increases fall risk.
29914779,Fear of falling and low balance confidence are reported in both fallers and nonfallers and can potentially be more debilitating than a fall itself.
29914779,"Therefore , the objective of this scoping review was to examine and map the current research evidence of balance confidence and fear of falling in older adults with type 2 diabetes."
29914779,"A search of CINAHL , EMBASE and PubMed was conducted."
29914779,The search included MeSH terms and the key terms diabet * AND fear OR falls AND self - efficacy OR balance confidence.
29914779,Inclusion criteria were 1 ) population : older adults ( ≥ 65 years of age ) with type 2 diabetes ; and 2 ) outcome measure : balance confidence or fear of falling.
29914779,We included 21 studies : fear of falling ( n = 14 ) ; balance confidence ( n = 7 ).
29914779,"We categorized them into 4 themes : prevalence , severity , determinants and interventions."
29914779,"Determinants were further categorized into physical , psychosocial and health - related domains."
29914779,Fear of falling and low balance confidence were highly prevalent and more severe in older adults with type 2 diabetes.
29914779,Determinants of fear of falling and balance confidence occurred beyond the physical domain and the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
29914779,"Targeted group - based interventions ( e.g. gait and balance training , tai chi , yoga ) appear to be beneficial in reducing fear of falling and improving balance confidence."
29914779,Future work is needed to generate best practices related to fear of falling and low balance confidence in older adults with type 2 diabetes.
29129000,"Aim To summarize , critically review , and interpret the evidence related to the systematic reviews on health literacy ( HL ) amongst type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM )."
29129000,"Methods The methodology for this study consisted of a systematic review of systematic reviews , using the PRISMA statement and flowchart to select studies , and searching on PubMed , CINAHL , Scopus , and Cochrane."
29129000,The search covered the period between January 2006 and June 2016.
29129000,"Results From the 115 identified record by the queries , only six systematic reviews were included , following a quality evaluation using AMSTAR."
29129000,"The included systematic reviews content was analyzed by the independent work of two authors , using a narrative synthesis approach."
29129000,"The findings of this study ( i.e. , main themes ) are areas of consensus and gaps in knowledge."
29129000,"Areas of consensus are HL definition , HL measurement tools , and the relationship between T2DM patient knowledge ( or literacy ) and his / her HL."
29129000,"The gaps in knowledge were the assessment of the relations between HL and health outcomes and self - efficacy , the gender differences , the effectiveness of interventions to improve HL , the cost - effectiveness study of interventions to improve HL , and the understanding of the influence of organizational environment on HL."
29129000,Conclusion This review provides a current state of knowledge to address clinical practice and research proposals.
29129000,"HL could be useful to personalize patients ' follow - up and it should be routinely assessed in its three dimensions ( i.e. functional , interactive and critical ) to enhance patients ' ability to cope with clinical recommendations."
29129000,Future research should be mainly aimed to test the effectiveness of evidence - based interventions to improve HL amongst T2DM patients.
30360498,"A low carbohydrate diet ( LCD ) , with some staple food being replaced with nuts , has been shown to reduce weight , improve blood glucose , and regulate blood lipid in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM )."
30360498,These nuts include tree nuts and ground nuts.
30360498,Tree nut consumption is associated with improved cardio - vascular and inflammatory parameters.
30360498,"However , the consumption of tree nuts is difficult to promote in patients with diabetes because of their high cost."
30360498,"As the main ground nut , peanuts contain a large number of beneficial nutrients , are widely planted , and are affordable for most patients."
30360498,"However , whether peanuts and tree nuts in combination with LCD have similar benefits in patients with T2DM remains unknown ; although almonds are the most consumed and studied tree nut."
30360498,"This study sought to compare the effect of peanuts and almonds , incorporated into a LCD , on cardio - metabolic and inflammatory measures in patients with T2DM."
30360498,"Of the 32 T2DM patients that were recruited , 17 were randomly allocated to the Peanut group ( n = 17 ) and 15 to the Almond group ( n = 15 ) in a parallel design."
30360498,The patients consumed a LCD with part of the starchy staple food being replaced with peanuts ( Peanut group ) or almonds ( Almond group ).
30360498,The follow - up duration was three months.
30360498,"The indicators for glycemic control , other cardio - metabolic , and inflammatory parameters were collected and compared between the two groups."
30360498,Twenty - five patients completed the study.
30360498,There were no significant differences in the self - reported dietary compliance between the two groups.
30360498,"Compared with the baseline , the fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) and postprandial 2 - h blood glucose ( PPG ) decreased in both the Peanut and Almond groups ( p < 0.05 )."
30360498,"After the intervention , no statistically significant differences were found between the Peanut group and the Almond group with respect to the FBG and PPG levels."
30360498,A decrease in the glycated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) level from the baseline in the Almond group was found ( p < 0.05 ).
30360498,"However , no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to the HbA1c level at the third month."
30360498,The peanut and almond consumption did not increase the body mass index ( BMI ) and had no effect on the blood lipid profile or interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ).
30360498,"In conclusion , incorporated into a LCD , almonds and peanuts have a similar effect on improving fasting and postprandial blood glucose among patients with T2DM."
30360498,"However , more studies are required to fully establish the effect of almond on the improvement of HbA1c."
30135724,Depression is twice as common in type 2 diabetes as in the general population and is associated with adverse health outcomes.
30135724,Growing evidence suggest that type 2 diabetes and depression share biological mechanisms.
30135724,"This brief commentary discusses current understanding of shared biological pathways , focussing on hyperglycaemia , ( micro ) vascular dysfunction , and low - grade inflammation."
30135724,"Although there is accumulating evidence that these pathways are involved in the link between type 2 diabetes and depression , direct evidence of their temporal associations is lacking because of a paucity of longitudinal studies that focus on the pathobiology of both type 2 diabetes and depression."
31376400,Aim : To summarize the existing literature concerning the association between polypharmacy and adverse health consequences in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
31376400,"Methods : We searched four literature databases ( PubMed / Medline , ScienceDirect and Web of Science ) through April 2019."
31376400,"We included all studies that addressed the association between polypharmacy and all - cause of mortality , glycemic control , macrovacular complications , hospitalization , potentially inappropriate medicines , drug - drug interactions and fall."
31376400,A statistical program OpenMeta [ Analyst ] was used.
31376400,The pooled odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated with a random effects model.
31376400,I2 statistics was performed to assess heterogeneity.
31376400,"Results : Out of sixteen studies , three studies were used for meta - analysis."
31376400,"A statistically significant association was found between polypharmacy and all - cause mortality ( OR = 1.622 , 95 % CI ( 1.606 - 1.637 ) P < 0.001 ) , and myocardial infarction ( OR = 1.962 , 95 % CI ( 1.942 - 1.982 ) , P < 0.001."
31376400,"Non-statistically significant association with evidence of moderate heterogeneity was found between polypharmacy and stroke ( OR = 1.335 ; 95 % CI ( 0.532 - 3.346 ) , P = 0.538 , I2 = 45 % ) , and hospitalization ( OR = 1.723 ; 95 % CI ( 0.983 - 3.021 ) , P = 0.057 , I2 = 57 % )."
31376400,"Conclusions : Pooled risk estimates reveal that polypharmacy is associated with increased all - cause mortality , macrovacular complications and hospitalization using categorical definitions."
31376400,These findings assert the need for interventions that optimize the balance of benefits and harms in medicines prescribing.
28093996,Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is a chronic disease with long - term complications.
28093996,Glycemic control is an important part in management of DM.
28093996,The first line in treatment of type 2 DM ( T2DM ) is diet and life style change.
28093996,Metformin is the first choice of medication in T2DM patients.
28093996,Sulfonylureas have high risk of hypoglycemia.
28093996,Glinides are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia in comparison to sulfonylureas.
28093996,"Also , α - glucosidase inhibitors decrease the polysaccharides ' digestion in small intestine and are less effective in comparison to metformin and sulfonylureas in lowering hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c )."
28093996,"These have no risk for hypoglycemia , but gastrointestinal symptoms are common."
28093996,"Thiazolidinediones are known as insulin sensitizers and are effective for a longer duration in comparison to sulfonylureas , however , have side effects such as fluid retention , edema and heart failure."
28093996,"Incretin mimetics including exenatide and liraglutide act through increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells , in a glucose - dependent manner."
28093996,"Therefore , these are associated with no risk of hypoglycemia."
28093996,Pramlintide is an amylin agonist which is also effective in lowering postprandial blood glucose.
28093996,Sitagliptin and vildagliptin are dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitors and have no risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy.
28093996,Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin decrease blood glucose level by increasing urinary glucose excretion and are associated with weight loss.
30641740,Aims : Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide that requires a person with diabetes to make a multitude of daily self - management decisions.
30641740,This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a self - management program based on PRECEDE - PROCEDE model on self - management behaviors in patients with type 2 diabetes.
30641740,"Methods : This experimental study was conducted on 86 diabetic patients referred to the diabetes clinics in Ardabil , Iran , in 2017."
30641740,"From a total of 326 patients with diabetes medical records in those clinics , 86 ( 26.3 % ) patients agreed to participate in this study."
30641740,They were then randomly divided into two groups ; intervention ( n = 43 ) and control ( n = 43 ).
30641740,The intervention group received eight sessions of PRECEDE model - based self - management education program while the control group did not receive any education program.
30641740,Both groups were assessed at baseline and six months after the intervention.
30641740,Results : The mean age of the participants was 55.69 ± 12.04 years ( range 32 - 86 years ).
30641740,"41 patients were men , and 45 were women."
30641740,"The mean time since the first diagnosis of diabetes was 8.6 years ( SD = 5.2 ) , and the mean BMI of the patients was 31.63 ( SD = 4.20 )."
30641740,"At baseline , 35.01 % of patients had poor self - management behaviors."
30641740,"All PRECEDE variables , including predisposing factors ( knowledge , attitude , and self - efficacy ) , enabling factors , and reinforcing factors , as well as self - management behaviors , were significantly improved in those of intervention group after the education program."
30641740,Conclusion : Self - management education program substantially enhances the self - management behaviors in patients with type two diabetes.
31336461,Both Type 1 [ T1DM ] and Type 2 diabetes mellitus [ T2DM ] share a nexus with altered thyroid status.
31336461,"In recent times , evidences point to the link between thyroid hormones andT2DM in particular."
31336461,Several lines of evidences suggest an array of biochemical and molecular events.
31336461,"Gene polymorphism , disturbances in gene expression and regulation , enhanced and bizarre absorption of dietary glucose from intestine , decreased utilization of glucose by tissues and aberrations in hepatic handling of glucose with the onus on Gluconeogenesis are some of the projected mechanisms."
31336461,"Insulin resistance , a progressive condition is the hallmark in T2DM."
31336461,Hypothyroidism as well as hyperthyroidism have been associated with insulin resistance which are synonymous with impaired glucose metabolism in T2DM.
31336461,"A multitude of basic , clinical and molecular studies provide an insight into thyroid comorbidity in T2DM , though there are a few instances to suggest equivocal link denoting cause - effect relationship."
31336461,"In biochemical pharmacology , as fortified by pharmacogenomics , modalities have now been proposed , through drug trials , to underline the utility of specifically designed thyroid hormone analogues in addressing metabolic syndrome , DM and associated cardiovascular pathology."
31336461,"A thorough understanding of the physiological , biochemical and molecular mechanisms would certainly open newer vistas in the perspectives of T2DM with special reference to alterations in thyroid status."
29080584,Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease affecting approximately 9 % of the United States population.
29080584,Successful management of diabetes demands constant self - management on the part of the patient.
29080584,"The patient has to balance diabetes medications , blood glucose monitoring , food intake , physical activity , and management of diabetes - related acute and chronic complications."
29080584,"The patient is often bombarded with misinformation from friends , relatives , and such sources as the Internet and social media."
29080584,"This article discusses the current recommendations for diabetes self - management education and skills including medical nutrition therapy , physical activity , smoking cessation , and assessment for diabetes distress."
17059973,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is a heterogeneous group of metabolic diseases resulting from defects in insulin secretion , insulin action , or both."
17059973,It comprises most diagnosed cases of diabetes and disproportionately affects minorities.
17059973,"This article describes the classification of diabetes mellitus ; defines the metabolic syndrome ; and discusses the diagnosis , risk factors , and screening criteria for T2DM."
17059973,"The pathophysiology of T2DM , its acute and chronic complications , and signs and symptoms are presented , along with a brief overview of treatment."
24527480,"Women and men with T2DM share many of the same risks and challenges in managing their disease , yet there are important differences between the genders that have been highlighted in this article."
24527480,"Understanding and applying the knowledge of these differences in clinical practice is essential to assist women with T2DM so as to improve their diabetes self - management , function , quality of life , and clinical outcomes."
24527480,"Of course , as with men , prevention of diabetes remains an important management objective."
26575297,Purpose of review : Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) negatively affects brain structure and function.
26575297,"Meta - analytical data show that relative to age and sex matched non-psychiatric controls , patients with bipolar disorders have double the risk of T2DM."
26575297,We review the evidence for association between T2DM and adverse clinical and brain imaging changes in bipolar disorders and summarize studies investigating effects of diabetes treatment on psychiatric and brain outcomes.
26575297,"Recent findings : Participants with bipolar disorders and T2DM or insulin resistance demonstrate greater morbidity , chronicity and disability , and lower treatment response to Li."
26575297,Bipolar disorders complicated by insulin resistance / T2DM are associated with smaller hippocampal and cortical gray matter volumes and lower prefrontal N - acetyl aspartate ( neuronal marker ).
26575297,"Treatment of T2DM yields preservation of brain gray matter and insulin sensitizers , such as pioglitazone , improve symptoms of depression in unipolar or bipolar disorders."
26575297,Summary : T2DM or insulin resistance frequently cooccur with bipolar disorders and are associated with negative psychiatric clinical outcomes and compromised brain health.
26575297,"This is clinically concerning , as patients with bipolar disorders have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and yet often receive suboptimal medical care."
26575297,At the same time treatment of T2DM and insulin resistance has positive effects on psychiatric and brain outcomes.
26575297,"These findings create a rich agenda for future research , which could enhance psychiatric pharmacopeia and directly impact patient care."
10943809,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus , a significant cause of adult morbidity and mortality , is being diagnosed more frequently in children and adolescents."
10943809,Genetic predisposition and environmental factors are important determinants for the expression of this disease.
10943809,"Blacks , Hispanic Americans , and Native Americans are known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus as adults and there appears to be increased prevalence of the disease in adolescent members of these groups."
10943809,"Obesity , sedentary lifestyle , and high - fat diet are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
10943809,A combination of peripheral insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency results in chronic hyperglycemia.
10943809,The onset of hyperglycemia is usually slow and symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia are often subtle and may go unrecognized by the patient.
10943809,The treatment of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus is an area of active study.
10943809,Programs targeting diet modification and increased physical activity are being developed in hopes of delaying or preventing the onset of disease.
10943809,"This paper examines risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus , reviews diagnostic criteria , and discusses newly established screening criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents."
12092688,Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) has been described as a new epidemic affecting the American pediatric population.
12092688,This is coincident with an overall 33 % increase in DM prevalence documented during the last decade.
12092688,"In 1992 , type 2 DM was a rare occurrence in most pediatric centers."
12092688,"By 1994 , it represented up to 16 % of new cases in urban areas , and by 1999 , the incidence of new type 2 DM diagnoses ranged between 8 % and 45 % , depending on geographic location."
12092688,"These patients have been observed primarily in African American , Mexican American , Native American , and Asian American children and youth."
12092688,"As in the adult population , type 2 DM in children and youth occurs as a result of insulin resistance coupled with relative beta - cell failure."
12092688,"While there appears to be a host of potential genetic and environmental risk factors for these aberrations , perhaps the most significant risk factor is obesity."
12092688,"Other risk factors include a family history of type 2 DM , puberty , intrauterine exposure to DM , sedentary lifestyle , female gender , and certain ethnicities."
12092688,"To date , few studies have addressed the role of physical activity and nutrition counseling in improving glycemic outcome , the most effective ways to reduce cardiovascular risk , or the most effective treatment regimens for this population."
12092688,"Once type 2 DM is established , the persistence of obesity often interferes with the response to treatment and exacerbates the comorbidities of hypertension , dyslipidemia , atherosclerosis , and polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS )."
12092688,"Since fewer than 10 % of youth with type 2 DM can be treated with diet and exercise alone , pharmacological intervention is generally required to achieve normoglycemic targets."
12092688,"In most surveys , practitioners prescribe insulin or an oral agent , most often metformin."
12092688,Specific treatment algorithms for pediatric patients with type 2 DM need to be rigorously investigated.
11841952,"While diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 used to be distinguished largely by age at onset , in the past decade there has been an increase in the number of children presenting with diabetes that can be controlled with oral medications."
11841952,This has lead to these children being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus despite their young age.
11841952,"This chapter offers an overview of presenting features , pathophysiology , treatment and prognosis of this disorder in the adolescent patient."
11841952,"Additionally , it offers information regarding the relationship between increasing childhood obesity and a rise in the reported cases of diabetes in children."
11841952,"Appropriate screening and laboratory tests and their results are explained , and the pros and cons of both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies are discussed."
11841952,"Some complications of diabetes in the developing adolescent differ from those adults will face , and the well - known complications of diabetes ( hyperlipidemia , hypertension ) must be addressed in a population that is not normally screened for these health concerns."
11841952,"It is hoped that by educating physicians to the potential for this disorder in their adolescent patients , long - term complications can be reduced and advanced sequelae of vascular and neurologic problems can possibly be avoided altogether."
31775555,"Background : In 2014 , the total prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 422 million people worldwide."
31775555,"Due to the aging population and continued increase in obesity rates , the prevalence is expected to rise to 592 million by 2035."
31775555,"Diabetes can lead to several complications , including cardiovascular disease , stroke , peripheral arterial disease , nephropathy , neuropathy , retinopathy , lower extremity amputation , and musculoskeletal impairments."
31775555,"Clinical question : Up to 80 % of patients referred for outpatient physical therapy have diabetes or are at risk for diabetes , providing an opportunity for physical therapists to intervene."
31775555,"Therefore , we asked , "" What is the role of physical therapists in fighting the diabetes epidemic ?"""
31775555,"Key results : Physical therapists commonly prescribe physical activity for the treatment of diabetes and other chronic diseases , such as cardiovascular disease and osteoarthritis."
31775555,Physical therapists may also screen for risk factors for diabetes and diabetes - related complications and modify traditional musculoskeletal exercise prescription accordingly.
31775555,Physical therapists must advocate for regular physical activity as a key component of the treatment of chronic diseases in all patient interactions.
31775555,"Clinical application : This commentary ( 1 ) describes the diabetes epidemic and the health impact of diabetes and diabetes - related complications , ( 2 ) highlights the physical therapist 's role as front - line provider , and ( 3 ) provides recommendations for physical therapists in screening for diabetes risk factors and diabetes - related complications and considerations for patient management."
31775555,We focus on type 2 diabetes.

15832489,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus was considered an exclusive disease of adulthood until the late 1970s , when reports of an increased prevalence in the pediatric age group emerged in the literature."
15832489,"The concerning upswing in the rate of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents has continued , parallel to the increasing rates of obesity."
15832489,The disease is not specific to the U.S. ; it has proven to be a global problem.
15832489,"The current information on type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents is mostly extrapolated from studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus , due to the paucity of studies conducted in youth."
15832489,"Obesity , family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus , minority ethnicity and race , polycystic ovary syndrome , maternal diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance during gestation , and acanthosis nigricans are the major risk factors and markers of youth - onset type 2 diabetes mellitus."
15832489,"The pathophysiology , which involves both an insulin secretion defect and resistance to insulin , needs further clarification in pediatric studies."
15832489,"Current management approaches involve lifestyle modification ( nutritional and exercise ) along with pharmacologic agents , such as insulin and oral antihyperglycemic medications , as indicated."
15832489,A recent study on the use of metformin in childhood - onset type 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrated the drug to be effective and to have a good safety profile in this population.
15832489,"However , the outcomes of ongoing studies and future studies focusing on type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pediatric age group will be crucial in terms of fine - tuning management plans and setting up appropriate prevention strategies."
15479774,Objective : To review the currently available insulin analogs and the benefits of insulin therapy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
15479774,Data sources : A MEDLINE search ( 1990 - March 2004 ) was conducted using insulin and type 2 diabetes mellitus as search terms to identify clinical trials and review articles.
15479774,The bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed.
15479774,Study selection and data extraction : All articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and deemed relevant if they included and assessed clinical outcomes.
15479774,"Data synthesis : Since its discovery in 1922 , insulin therapy has been the only available pharmacologic treatment for type 1 diabetes and a mainstay therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes who fail to obtain glycemic control with oral antidiabetic agents."
15479774,This article reviews the current insulin analogs available on the market and insulin regimens that are designed to mimic the pancreatic beta - cells ' response to a glucose load.
15479774,Conclusions : Insulin therapy is often withheld until late in the disease process for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
15479774,This results in an enormous burden of disease for patients.
15479774,Insulin therapy is beneficial in obtaining glycemic control and may attenuate the complications associated with diabetes.
29298108,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) and heart failure ( HF ) are closely related , with the onset of one serving as an independent risk factor for the development or progression of the other."
29298108,The true impact of their relationship is poorly understood.
29298108,"Since various classes of glucose - lowering therapies have been shown to have differing impact on cardiovascular outcomes , cardiovascular effects of such therapies have been increasingly formally evaluated."
29298108,"Areas covered : With the increasing prevalence of concomitant HF and type 2 DM , HF outcomes serve as important endpoints in trials of glucose - lowering therapies."
29298108,A thorough literature search of recent cardiovascular outcome trials of glucose - lowering therapies was performed.
29298108,The authors focus on the availability and extent of ascertainment of data related to HF outcomes in these contemporary clinical trial experiences.
29298108,"Expert commentary : Although early cardiovascular outcome trials did not focus on HF events , these outcomes have been increasingly recognized as meaningful end points in cardiovascular outcome trials."
29298108,The ascertainment of HF end point data needs to become routine and standardized.
30741763,"Of the more than 30 million Americans who have diabetes mellitus , as many as 95 % have type 2 diabetes."
30741763,"While interventions for type 2 diabetes include modifying diet and exercise , pharmacologic therapy is a mainstay in diabetes treatment."
30741763,"In recent years , with the addition of new medications and medication classifications , pharmacologic therapy for type 2 diabetes has changed dramatically."
30741763,Nurses need to understand the many pharmacologic agents and combination therapies now in use.

27074851,"Type 2 diabetes is a disorder of ages , which has become deadlier because of life style modification and adaptation in the modern world."
27074851,Extensive sudy of the pathophysiology of diabetes has opened up various mysteries about the disease and has helped us to know and understand diabetes in a better manner.
27074851,"Presently , we know many minute details about the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and are thus well weaponed to fight against it."
27074851,Treatment regime has been evolving daily.
27074851,"Besides the conventional anti-diabetic drugs , integrated medicinal approach for treating diabetes type 2 with a compact therapeutic approach consisting of various targeted treatments for individual symptoms associated with the disease are being tried currently."
27074851,"Diabetes associated complications like high blood pressure , hyperglycemia , microalbumuria , dyslipidemia , pro - coagulation , etc. are being targeted and dealt with individually in the integrative medicinal approach."
27074851,The results are promising and thus ignite hope for a better and more successful handling of diabetes and diabetes related pathophysiological complications in near future.
18806081,"As rates of childhood obesity climb , type 2 diabetes mellitus has increasingly been diagnosed in children and adolescents , with the highest incidence occurring among youth from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds."
18806081,"The serious complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus make it essential for physicians to be aware of risk factors and screening guidelines , allowing for earlier patient diagnosis and treatment."
18806081,"It is also important for physicians to be aware of the treatment options available , including weight control through diet and exercise as well as common pharmacotherapeutic options."
27156051,"The global increase in type 2 diabetes prevalence is well documented , but international trends in complications of type 2 diabetes are less clear."
27156051,"The available data suggest large reductions in classic complications of type 2 diabetes in high - income countries over the past 20 years , predominantly reductions in myocardial infarction , stroke , amputations , and mortality."
27156051,"These trends might be accompanied by less obvious , but still important , changes in the character of morbidity in people with diabetes."
27156051,"In the USA , for example , substantial reductions in macrovascular complications in adults aged 65 years or older mean that a large proportion of total complications now occur among adults aged 45 - 64 years instead , rates of renal disease could persist more than other complications , and obesity - related type 2 diabetes could have increasing effect in youth and adults under 45 years of age."
27156051,"Additionally , the combination of decreasing mortality and increasing diabetes prevalence has increased the overall mean years lived with diabetes and could lead to a diversification of diabetes morbidity , including continued high rates of renal disease , ageing - related disability , and cancers."
27156051,"Unfortunately , data on trends in diabetes - related complications are limited to only about a dozen countries , most of which are high income , leaving the changing character for countries of low and middle income ambiguous."
24070804,The epidemic of overweight and obesity is a major driver of the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus globally.
24070804,The risk of type 2 diabetes increases exponentially as body mass index rises above 25 kg / m ( 2 ).
24070804,Obesity currently costs the Canadian economy approximately $ 7.1 billion annually whereas per capita health care cost for individuals with diabetes are 3 to 4 times that for persons without the disease.
24070804,Each kilogram of weight lost through health behaviour changes in people with impaired glucose tolerance is associated with a relative diabetes risk reduction of 16 %.
24070804,"As 80 % to 90 % of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese , and adiposity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes , weight loss is recommended as the cornerstone management measure."
24070804,A modest weight loss of 5 % to 10 % is an achievable and realistic goal for preventing type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals and improving glycemic and metabolic control in people with type 2 diabetes.
24070804,"When health behaviour modification fails to achieve glycemic and metabolic goal targets , priority should be given to antihyperglycemic agents that are associated with weight loss or weight neutrality."
24070804,Every pound of body fat loss matters and every kilogram counts in the management of type 2 diabetes.
25172521,"The circadian clock drives a number of metabolic processes including energy intake , storage and utilization coupled with the sleep / wake cycles."
25172521,"Globally , the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) has become a significant international public health concern."
25172521,"In view of the heavy societal burden caused by diabetes , and further , to reduce its growing incidence , it is clearly essential to understand the causes of this disease and to devise more effective strategies for its treatment."
25172521,"Although many factors cause T2DM , this article centers on the role of circadian regulation of metabolism."
25172521,The correlation between the increased occurrence of T2DM and the ubiquity of modern social pressures such as 24/7 lifestyles as well as nocturnal lighting conditions point strongly to the hypothesis that malfunctioning of circadian controls may be involved in the etiology of the illness.
25172521,"Nocturnal light exposure , unusual timing of food , irregular sleep / wake schedules and traveling between different time zones are some of the factors responsible for improper entrainment of the clock."
25172521,Recent reports have proposed that strengthening of circadian clock functioning and proper timing of food intake could stabilize glucose homeostasis.
25172521,This strategy thus represents a chronotherapeutic option for non-pharmaceutical intervention in treating T2DM patients.
10609116,Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease of adults and has been considered rare in the pediatric population.
10609116,"Over the last decade , however , there has been a disturbing trend of increasing cases of type 2 diabetes in children , particularly adolescents , and with a greater proportion of minority children being affected."
10609116,"This article reviews the clinical characteristics of youth with type 2 diabetes , presents the risk factors associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes , discusses treatment options , and projects future directions in research."
10609116,The ultimate goal is to raise awareness of this challenging entity among healthcare professionals.
30353895,"Background Diastolic dysfunction is an inability of the ventricle to fill to a normal end - diastolic volume , both during exercise as well as at rest."
30353895,Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of heart failure even in the absence of other co-morbidities.
30353895,"Objective To find the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and its association with age , gender , duration , glycosylated hemoglobin levels , dyslipidemia , tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption."
30353895,"Method Ninety patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus of both genders , aged 30 to 60 years , were included in this study."
30353895,Doppler echocardiography was performed to evaluate diastolic dysfunction.
30353895,Result The mean age of the study population was 46.21 ± 9.20 yrs.
30353895,The overall prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in the study population was 47.8 %.
30353895,"The prevalence of diastolic dysfunction increases with age : 23.1 % in patients of age 30 - 39 yrs to 65.8 % in patients of age 50 - 60 yrs ( adjusted OR 0.16 , 95 % CI 0.04 - 0.64 , P = 0.010 ) and with the duration of diabetes : 32.8 % in patients with diabetes for < 5 yrs to 75 % in patients with diabetes for > 10 yrs ( adjusted OR 0.31 , 95 % CI 0.08 - 1.00 , P = 0.05 )."
30353895,"There was no significant association between diastolic dysfunction and dyslipidaemia , BMI , tobacco smoking , alcohol consumption , HbA1c and gender."
30353895,Conclusion Prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus was 47.8 % in our study.
30353895,A rising trend of prevalence of diastolic dysfunction with the duration of diabetes and increasing age of patients was observed.
33157114,"Introduction : Sleep quality , quantity and timing have been shown to impact glycaemic control , with a role in insulin sensitivity , glucose tolerance and HbA1C levels , in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations."
33157114,The aim of this study was to identify recommendations for sleep assessment and management in international clinical practice guidelines focused on type 2 diabetes mellitus management in adults.
33157114,Study design : Systematic Review.
33157114,Methodology : Clinical practice guidelines which focused on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults were included ( n = 35 ).
33157114,Two independent reviewers utilised the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation tool ( AGREE ) II and a third reviewer resolved any disagreements.
33157114,Included guidelines were assessed for recommendations about sleep in diabetes management ( n = 14 ).
33157114,"Data were extracted on sleep recommendations , themes were generated from the extracted data and narrative syntheses were created."
33157114,"Results : From 1114 identified papers , 35 guidelines met the inclusion criteria."
33157114,"Fourteen of these guidelines included recommendations pertaining to sleep , which broadly fell into five categories ; sleep assessment , sleep as a therapeutic target , sleep and co-morbidities of type 2 diabetes mellitus , shift work and sleep and driving."
33157114,Recommendations varied across guidelines.
33157114,Conclusion : Few guidelines provided recommendations relating to assessment and management of sleep in type 2 diabetes care.
33157114,Most of the recommendations were related to obstructive sleep apnoea.
33157114,"However , few guidelines discussed sleep as a therapeutic intervention for diabetes mellitus or described the potential importance of sleep quality and duration in glycaemic control."

27390262,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chief concern for patients , healthcare providers , and health care systems in America , and around the globe."
27390262,Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus exhibit clinical and subclinical symptoms of anxiety more frequently than people without diabetes.
27390262,Anxiety is traditionally associated with poor metabolic outcomes and increased medical complications among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
27390262,"Collaborative care models have been utilized in the multidisciplinary treatment of mental health problems and chronic disease , and have demonstrated success in managing the pathology of depression which often accompanies diabetes."
27390262,"However , no specific treatment model has been published that links the treatment of anxiety to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus."
27390262,"Given the success of collaborative care models in treating depression associated with diabetes , and anxiety unrelated to chronic disease , it is possible that the collaborative care treatment of primary care patients who suffer from both anxiety and diabetes could be met with the same success."
27390262,The key issue is determining how to implement and sustain these models in practice.
27390262,"This review summarizes the proposed link between anxiety and diabetes , and offers an innovative and evidence - based collaborative care model for anxiety and diabetes in primary care."
29196150,Cardiovascular risk reduction in individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is a key part of clinical management.
29196150,"Sodium - glucose co-transporter ( SGLT2 ) inhibitors improve glycaemic control , reduce body weight and decrease blood pressure."
29196150,"In addition , the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin reduced the risk of composite cardiovascular events in high - risk individuals with T2DM in the EMPA - REG OUTCOME trial and the CANVAS Program , respectively."
29196150,Empagliflozin also reduced cardiovascular deaths and improved renal outcomes.
29196150,"This class of agents should be considered in people with established cardiovascular disease , usually in combination with other glucose lowering medications , when satisfactory glycaemic control has not been achieved."
29196150,"The dose of insulin or sulfonylureas may need to be lowered when used with SGLT2 inhibitors , to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia."
29196150,Genitourinary infections can occur with SGLT2 inhibitors in a small proportion of people.
29196150,"In people with osteoporosis or prior amputation , it may be prudent to use empagliflozin rather than canagliflozin , based on the increased risk for bone fractures and amputations observed with canagliflozin in the CANVAS Program."
29196150,"SGLT2 inhibitors have the potential to transform the clinical care of persons with T2DM by not only improving glycaemic control but also reducing blood pressure , body weight and diabetes - related end - organ complications."
28755061,"Purpose of review : The purpose of this paper was to review studies of behavioral economic interventions ( financial incentives , choice architecture modifications , or commitment devices ) to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) among at - risk patients or improve self - management among patients with T2DM."
28755061,"Recent findings : We found 15 studies that used varied study designs and outcomes to test behavioral economic interventions in clinical , workplace , or health plan settings."
28755061,"Of four studies that focused on prevention of T2DM , two found that financial incentives increased weight loss and completion of a fasting blood glucose test , and two choice architecture modifications had mixed effects in encouraging completion of tests to screen for T2DM."
28755061,"Of 11 studies that focused on improving self - management of T2DM , four of six tests of financial incentives demonstrated increased engagement in recommended care processes or improved biometric measures , and three of five tests of choice architecture modifications found improvements in self - management behaviors."
28755061,"Though few studies have tested behavioral economic interventions for prevention or treatment of T2DM , those that have suggested such approaches have the potential to improve patient behaviors and such approaches should be tested more broadly."
10418073,Exercise has long been considered a cornerstone in the treatment regimen for patients with type 2 ( non-insulin-dependent ) diabetes mellitus.
10418073,Aerobic endurance exercise has traditionally been advocated as the most suitable exercise mode.
10418073,Several exercise studies have evaluated the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
10418073,"However , the results obtained have been highly heterogeneous regarding the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control."
10418073,"Only in certain subgroups ( e.g. patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under 55 years of age , those with diabetes treated through diet and those who have diabetes with fairly good metabolic control ) , does exercise seem to be beneficial with regard to improvement in glycaemic control."
10418073,There has been little research into the effects of resistance training on glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with the amount of research involving aerobic endurance exercise.
10418073,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus increases with increasing age , partly because of the decline in muscle mass associated with aging."
10418073,"This corresponds with a decline in metabolic function , supporting the usefulness of resistance training."
10418073,Available studies support the usefulness of resistance training in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
10418073,"Therefore , based on the published studies reviewed , this author proposes that an optimal exercise programme for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus should include components that improve cardiorespiratory fitness , muscular strength and endurance , i.e. a combination of aerobic endurance training and circuit - type resistance training."
10418073,Programmes combining various modes of exercise positively influence patient compliance with the exercise programme.
10418073,The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can undertake an individualised exercise programme without significantly increased risks of complications.
10348076,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( formerly called non-insulin-dependent diabetes ) causes abnormal carbohydrate , lipid and protein metabolism associated with insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion."
10348076,Insulin resistance is a major contributor to progression of the disease and to complications of diabetes.
10348076,Type 2 diabetes is a common and underdiagnosed condition that poses treatment challenges to family practitioners.
10348076,The introduction of new oral agents within the past three years has expanded the range of possible combination regimens available for treating type 2 diabetes.
10348076,"Despite the choice of pharmacologic agents , physicians must stress the nonpharmacologic approaches of diet modification , weight control and regular exercise."
10348076,"Pharmacologic approaches must be based on patient characteristics , level of glucose control and cost considerations."
10348076,Combinations of different oral agents may be useful for controlling hyperglycemia before insulin therapy becomes necessary.
10348076,"A stepped - care approach to drug therapy may provide the most rational , cost - efficient approach to management of this disease."
10348076,Pharmaco - economic analyses of clinical trials are needed to determine cost - effective treatment strategies for management of type 2 diabetes.
18418443,Evidence is reviewed supporting the presence of an inherited structural defect in the plasma membranes of somatic cells of humans who have type 2 diabetes mellitus and sodium - sensitive essential hypertension.
18418443,"This magnesium - binding defect ( MgBD ) consists of a decreased content of tightly bound Mg2 + ion in the cell membrane and limits the amount of Mg2 + that enters the cell , some of which combines with ATP4 - , produced by the cell , to form MgATP2 - , the currency of metabolic energy."
18418443,"Consequently , in both prediabetes and overt diabetes , the intracellular concentration of the interdependent Mg2 + and MgATP2 - ions is significantly less than normal."
18418443,"These 2 ions are required as cofactors and ( or ) substrates for some 300 enzyme systems in human metabolism , many of which are involved with insulin."
18418443,"Thus the decreased activities of particular ones of these enzyme systems due to the decreased intracellular [ Mg2 + ] and its dependent [ MgATP2 - ] are responsible for ( i ) insulin resistance and ( ii ) decreased insulin secretion and ( or ) production , the 2 pathophysiological processes required for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus."
18418443,These 2 processes can account for all of the morbid symptoms associated with this disease.
18418443,"Thus , the decreased intracellular concentration of the interdependent Mg2 + and MgATP2 - ions constitutes the etiology of genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes mellitus and can be corrected by 2 identified peptide Mg2 + - binding promoters that are derived from the carboxyl terminal of the tachykinin substance P and occur in normal blood plasma."
18418443,"Decreased intracellular [ Mg2 + ] and [ MgATP2 - ] can also result from a dietary deficiency of magnesium or from an abnormal accumulation of saturated fatty acids in cell membranes , which inhibits the entrance of Mg2 + into the cell ; thus it is also the etiology not only of diabetes caused by magnesium deficiency , but also of the "" lipotoxic "" type 2 diabetes mellitus."
18418443,"Although these pathologies can not be corrected by the Mg2 + - binding promoters , they can be corrected , respectively , by dietary magnesium supplementation or by exercise plus dietary caloric and lipid restriction."
18418443,"Theoretically , the disease syndrome containing type 2 diabetes mellitus may involve approximately 30 % of the population."
23065368,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents has increased over the last 2 decades , paralleled by an increase in obesity over the same time period."
23065368,"Although the value of lifestyle modification in obese youth is unquestioned , scant evidence for optimal treatment of type 2 diabetes in this age group exists."
23065368,"Despite recent therapeutic drug trials , metformin and insulin are the only medicines currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in youth."
23065368,"Because of recently amended pharmaceutical regulations , however , it is likely that more antidiabetic medications soon will be added to the armamentarium of therapeutic options for youth with type 2 diabetes."
23065368,"Additionally , the recently published TODAY study comparing safety and efficacy of three treatment regimens in maintaining glycemic control in youth with type 2 diabetes has shed new light on the problem."
25866823,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , a chronic disease increasing rapidly worldwide , is well established as an important risk factor for various types of cancer."
25866823,"Although many factors impact the development of T2DM and cancer including sex , age , ethnicity , obesity , diet , physical activity levels , and environmental exposure , many epidemiological and experimental studies are gradually contributing to knowledge regarding the interrelationship between DM and cancer."
25866823,"The insulin resistance , hyperinsulinemia , and chronic inflammation associated with diabetes mellitus are all associated strongly with cancer."
25866823,"The changes in bioavailable ovarian steroid hormone that occur in diabetes mellitus ( the increasing levels of estrogen and androgen and the decreasing level of progesterone ) are also considered potentially carcinogenic conditions for the breast , endometrium , and ovaries in women."
25866823,"In addition , the interaction among insulin , insulin - like growth factors ( IGFs ) , and ovarian steroid hormones , such as estrogen and progesterone , could act synergistically during cancer development."
25866823,"Here , we review the cancer - related mechanisms in T2DM , the epidemiological evidence linking T2DM and cancers in women , and the role of antidiabetic medication in these cancers."
11800064,"The leading cause of death among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is cardiovascular disease , with 75 % of these deaths attributed to coronary heart disease."
11800064,Over the previous two decades the pathophysiological basis of type 2 DM has been extensively investigated.
11800064,"Although many of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the development of this disorder remain to be explained , it is clear that type 2 DM is a complex medical disorder characterized by insulin resistance and defects in insulin secretion."
11800064,"The process through which the metabolic derangements of type 2 DM accelerate the development of cardiovascular disease in type 2 DM has yet to be determined and remains an area of intense investigation , focusing on hyperglycemia and insulin resistance as major underlying contributors."
11800064,This article explores current information related to the pathophysiology of type 2 DM alone and its relationship to the development to cardiovascular disease.
12489382,Economic considerations in treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are reviewed.
12489382,"Glycemic control , lipid profiles , and adherence to standards of care are less than optimal in many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
12489382,"Diabetes has an enormous economic impact , and its related costs in the United States are expected to increase as the frequency of the disease increases."
12489382,"A substantial portion of diabetes - related health care expenditures is allotted to the treatment of cardiovascular disease , a major complication of diabetes."
12489382,"Significant health care resources are spent in a reactive manner ( i.e. , after complications have developed ) , with little emphasis on preventive care."
12489382,"One large study conducted in the United Kingdom demonstrated that providing intensive blood glucose control significantly reduced the risk of microvascular complications , such as retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy , in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
12489382,"Factors to consider in selecting pharmacotherapy for these patients include the magnitude of change in measures of glycemic control provided by the medication , other desired metabolic changes and outcomes ( e.g. , blood pressure and lipid changes ) , mechanism of action , adverse effects , contraindications , patient adherence , and cost."
12489382,"Early interventions , such as annual urinalysis and screening for microalbuminemia , annual comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist , and screening for neuropathy and foot problems are cost - effective ways of reducing diabetes - related complications."
12489382,"Interventions recommended for reducing the risk for cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus include lipid control , blood pressure control , aspirin therapy , smoking cessation , and weight loss."
12489382,"Achieving and maintaining glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus improves quality of life and is cost - effective , especially among patients with comorbid heart disease , hypertension , or both."
27417914,Dyslipidemia is the most fundamental risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ).
27417914,"In clinical practice , many commonly prescribed medications can alter the patient 's lipid profile and , potentially , the risk for ASCVD - either favorably or unfavorably."
27417914,"The dyslipidemia observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) can be characterized as both ominous and cryptic , in terms of unrecognized , disproportionately elevated atherogenic cholesterol particle concentrations , in spite of deceptively and relatively lower levels of low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL - C )."
27417914,"Several factors , most notably insulin resistance , associated with the unfavorable discordance of elevated triglyceride ( TG ) levels and low levels of high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) , have been shown to correlate with an increased risk / number of ASCVD events in patients with T2DM."
27417914,"This review focuses on known changes in the routine lipid profile ( LDL - C , TGs , and HDL - C ) observed with commonly prescribed medications for patients with T2DM , including antihyperglycemic agents , antihypertensive agents , weight loss medications , antibiotics , analgesics , oral contraceptives , and hormone replacement therapies."
27417914,"Given that the risk of ASCVD is already elevated for patients with T2DM , the use of polypharmacy may warrant close observation of overall alterations through ongoing lipid - panel monitoring."
27417914,"Ultimately , the goal is to reduce levels of atherogenic cholesterol particles and thus the patient 's absolute risk."
19564886,"Our understanding of the genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) has changed , in part owing to implementation of genome - wide association studies as a method for unraveling the genetic architecture of complex traits."
19564886,These studies enable a global search throughout the nuclear genome for variants that are associated with specific phenotypes.
19564886,"Currently , single nucleotide polymorphisms in about 24 different genetic loci have been associated with T2DM."
19564886,Most of these genetic loci are associated with the insulin secretion pathway rather than insulin resistance.
19564886,"Study design , heritability differences and the intrinsic properties of in vivo insulin resistance measures might partially explain why only a few loci associated with insulin resistance have been detected through genome - wide association approaches."
19564886,"Despite the success of these approaches at detecting loci associated with T2DM , currently known associations explain only a small amount of the genetic variance involved in the disease."
19564886,"Compared with previous studies , larger cohorts might be needed to identify variants of smaller effect sizes and lower allele frequencies."
19564886,"Finally , the current list of genetic loci that are related to T2DM does not seem to offer greater predictive value in determining diabetes risk than do commonly used phenotypic risk factors and family history."
24023947,Objective : This review aimed to comprehensively assess the literature examining a possible link between the rs1801133 polymorphism ( 677C → T ) in the gene encoding the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) gene and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ).
24023947,Research design and methods : Several research databases were systematically searched for studies examining the genotype at the rs1801133 polymorphism in healthy control individuals and individuals with type 2 DM.
24023947,Genotype frequency data were examined across all studies and across subsets of studies according to ethnicity and presence of serious DM - related complications.
24023947,Odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated.
24023947,"Results : A total of 4855 individuals with type 2 DM and 5242 healthy controls from 15 countries comprising Asian , Caucasian and African ethnicities were found to satisfy the inclusion criteria and included in the review."
24023947,"Genotype at the rs1801133 polymorphism was not consistently associated with either increased or reduced risk of type 2 DM ; the OR across all studies was 0.91 ( 95 % CI 0.82 to 1.00 ) for the C - vs. T - allele , 0.88 ( 0.75 to 1.03 ) for CC vs. CT+TT , 0.82 ( 0.71 to 0.95 ) for CC vs. TT , and 1.15 ( 1.03 to 1.29 ) for TT vs. CC+CT."
24023947,"Similar results were found when the meta - analysis was repeated separately for each ethnic subgroup , and for subgroups with or without serious DM - related complications."
24023947,Conclusions : There does not appear to be compelling evidence of an association between the genotype at the rs1801133 polymorphism of the MTHFR gene and risk of type 2 DM.
17894523,Type 2 diabetes mellitus is reaching epidemic proportions among children and adolescents.
17894523,School health fairs offer an opportunity to identify children with risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
17894523,"This study identified selected risk factors ( i.e. , high - risk racial / ethnic group , obesity , elevated blood pressure , elevated casual blood glucose , elevated total cholesterol , and the presence of acanthosis nigricans ) for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in rural children with or without a family history of diabetes during annual school health fairs."
17894523,"Of the children screened , 40 % ( 673 ) presented with two or more of the identified risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus."
17894523,The presence of multiple risk factors in participants reporting a positive family history of diabetes mellitus versus those with no family history was not statistically significant.
17894523,"Based on the study results , factors other than family history may be more predictive for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in rural school children."
21128892,It is well known that type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ).
21128892,"A predicted worldwide increase in the incidence of T2DM , taking the form of an epidemic , is expected to induce a substantial increase in CVD incidence."
21128892,"Impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) and impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) are related to an increased risk of developing T2DM , especially in obese people."
21128892,"Prevention of T2DM aiming to reversal of pre-diabetes to normal glucose tolerance seems to be a very attractive target , and favourably affects CVD risk factors."
21128892,The Diabetes Prevention Program and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention studies showed that changes in lifestyle prevented or delayed the onset of new cases of T2DM in subjects with pre-diabetes by 58 %.
21128892,"However , a fraction of participants still developed T2DM , suggesting a residual risk."
21128892,"Moreover , lifestyle changes are not usually followed on a long - term basis as shown in EUROASPIRE with an increase in new onset T2DM by 60 % in subjects with CVD in just over a decade."
21128892,T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance and / or β - cell dysfunction ( impaired insulin secretion ).
21128892,"Various interventions targeting those two mechanisms ( e.g. metformin , thiazolidinediones , acarbose , orlistate , bariatric surgery , renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system axis inhibitors , fibrates , incretin mimetics or enhancers ) can prevent or delay T2DM."
21128892,"Widespread application of these measures has , however , been limited by financial considerations , even though cost - effectiveness might be achieved at the population level."
21128892,"This review will investigate feasibility and usefulness of T2DM prevention , further to that achieved with lifestyle changes , in a cost - effective manner."
19323960,"Little published research exists on psychosocial issues in adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , because until two decades ago , diabetes diagnosed in children and adolescents was almost exclusively type 1 diabetes mellitus or insulin - dependent diabetes."
19323960,"In the past two decades , rates of T2DM have increased , especially in adolescents from families of minority racial and ethnic groups."
19323960,"Youth with T2DM are most often obese , have a parent or other first - degree relative with T2DM , and are of low socioeconomic status."
19323960,"To understand the complex set of interrelated psychological and social influences that affect the well - being of youth with T2DM , levels of influence from determinants of genetics , family , and community / societal and minority ethnic groups must be included."
12408409,Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 17 million adults in the United States and has profound implications in terms of long - term microvascular and macrovascular complications and their associated costs.
12408409,"In type 2 diabetes , insulin resistance and a relative beta - cell defect are the underlying pathologic problems leading to hyperglycemia."
12408409,"Notably , insulin resistance is also associated with obesity , dyslipidemia , and hypertension."
12408409,Diabetes can be defined as a disease of accelerated cardiovascular deterioration associated with elevated blood glucose levels.
12408409,Glycemic control has been shown to reduce the long - term complications associated with diabetes.
12408409,"Although medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed increased physical activity are important components of a diabetes management plan , most patients need medication to lower glucose to near - normal levels."
12408409,"Therapeutic options for treating hyperglycemia include sulfonylureas and other insulin secretagogues , biguanides , alpha - glucosidase inhibitors , thiazolidinediones , and insulin."
12408409,An antidiabetic agent that improves insulin sensitivity is an excellent choice for early treatment of type 2 diabetes because it may delay or prevent complications associated with this disease.
12408409,"Because of the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes , aggressive intervention early in the course of the disease , including combination therapy , is often necessary."
11393500,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by 2 pathogenic defects , impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance."
11393500,The resultant hyperglycemia causes microvascular and macrovascular complications that increase morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus.
11393500,"Optimum glycemic control in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus prevents the development of microvascular disease and , to a lesser extent , macrovascular disease."
11393500,Prandial hyperglycemia may be an independent risk factor for the development of diabetic complications.
11393500,This article reviews the pathophysiologic mechanisms of glucose metabolism and describes the results of epidemiological and interventional studies that have demonstrated the association of acute and chronic hyperglycemia with the development of diabetic complications.
11393500,"The American Diabetes Association has defined diagnostic and treatment goals for diabetes mellitus , striving to achieve near - normal glycemic control to delay or prevent the development of diabetic complications."
11393500,A number of oral antidiabetic agents and insulins are currently available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States.
11393500,These agents target fasting and postmeal plasma glucose levels to improve glycemic control.
11393500,"Alone or in combination , these agents have enhanced the clinical approaches to treating diabetes mellitus."
16804198,"Feline diabetes mellitus ( FDM ) closely resembles human type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) in many respects including clinical , physiological , and pathological features of the disease."
16804198,"These features include age of onset of FDM in middle age , association with obesity , residual but declining insulin secretion , development of islet amyloid deposits , loss of approximately 50 % of beta - cell mass , and development of complications in several organ systems including peripheral polyneuropathy and retinopathy."
16804198,"Many of the pathological aspects of the disease are also experimentally inducible , facilitating study of the pathogenesis of these lesions."
16804198,Physiological aspects of FDM and obesity are also well studied in the cat and provide an excellent basis for comparative studies of human T2DM.
16804198,The relatively short generation time of cats along with breed predispositions to development of FDM may allow for more rapid screening and identification of genetic markers for diabetes susceptibility.
16804198,"FDM , in both spontaneous and inducible forms , therefore provides a good animal model of human T2DM and may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of this important condition."
31490989,Background : Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is an established risk factor for cardiovascular and nephropathic events.
31490989,"In the Netherlands , prevalence of T2DM is expected to be as high as 8 % by 2025."
31490989,"This will result in significant clinical and economic impact , highlighting the need for well - informed reimbursement decisions for new treatments."
31490989,"However , availability and consistent use of costing methodologies is limited."
31490989,Objective : We aimed to systematically review recent costing data for T2DM - related cardiovascular and nephropathic events in the Netherlands.
31490989,"Methods : A systematic literature review in PubMed and Embase was conducted to identify available Dutch cost data for T2DM - related events , published in the last decade."
31490989,"Information extracted included costs , source , study population , and costing perspective."
31490989,"Finally , papers were evaluated using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards ( CHEERS )."
31490989,"Results : Out of initially 570 papers , 36 agreed with the inclusion criteria."
31490989,"From these studies , 150 cost estimates for T2DM - related clinical events were identified."
31490989,"In total , 29 cost estimates were reported for myocardial infarction ( range : € 196 - € 27,038 ) , 61 for stroke ( € 495 - € 54,678 ) , fifteen for heart failure ( € 325 - € 16,561 ) , 24 for renal failure ( € 2,438 - € 91,503 ) , and seventeen for revascularisation ( € 3,000 - € 37,071 )."
31490989,"Only four estimates for transient ischaemic attack were available , ranging from € 587 to € 2,470."
31490989,Adherence to CHEERS was generally high.
31490989,"Conclusions : The most expensive clinical events were related to renal failure , while TIA was the least expensive event."
31490989,"Generally , there was substantial variation in reported cost estimates for T2DM - related events."
31490989,"Costing of clinical events should be improved and preferably standardised , as accurate and consistent results in economic models are desired."
22135872,"During the past four decades , Oman has undergone a rapid socioe - conomic and epidemiological transition leading to a substantial reduction in the prevalence of various communicable diseases , including vaccine - preventable diseases."
22135872,Health care planning together with the commitment of policy makers has been a critical factor in this reduction.
22135872,"However , with rapid social and economic growth , lifestyle - related non communicable diseases have emerged as new health challenges to the country."
22135872,Diabetes and obesity are leading risks posed by the chronic diseases.
22135872,"The burden of diabetes has increased sharply in Oman over the last decade , rising from 8.3 % in 1991 to 11.6 % in 2000 among adults aged 20 years and older."
22135872,"The World Health Organization ( WHO ) predicted an increase of 190 % in the number of subjects living with diabetes in Oman over the next 20 years , rising from 75,000 in 2000 to 217,000 in 2025."
22135872,There is a lack of awareness of the major risk factors for diabetes mellitus in the Omani population generally.
22135872,"As education is often the most significant predictor of knowledge regarding risk factors , complications and the prevention of diabetes , health promotion in Oman is deemed critical , along with other prevention and control measures."
22135872,Suitable prevention strategies for reducing the prevalence of diabetes in Oman are discussed.
22135872,"Recommendations are made for reforms in the current health care system ; otherwise , diabetes will constitute a major drain on Oman 's human and financial resources , threatening the advances in health and longevity achieved over the past decades."
29518575,"The global incidence of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2 ) has assumed epidemic proportions , leading to adverse health and socio - economic impacts."
29518575,It is therefore of critical importance the early diagnosis of DM2 patients and the detection of those at increased risk of disease.
29518575,"In this respect , Precision Medicine ( PM ) is an emerging approach that includes practices , tests , decisions and treatments adapted to the characteristics of each patient."
29518575,"With regard to DM2 , PM manages a wealth of "" omics "" data ( genomic , metabolic , proteomic , environmental , clinical and paraclinical ) to increase the number of clinically validated biomarkers in order to identify patients in early stage even before the prediabetic phase."
29518575,"Significance : In this paper , we discuss the epidemic dimension of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2 ) and the urgent demand for novel biomarkers to reduce the incidence or even delay the onset of DM2."
29518575,"Recent research data produced by "" multi-omics "" technologies ( genomics / epigenomics , transcriptomics , proteomics and metabolomics ) , suggest that many potential biomarkers might be helpful in the prediction and early diagnosis of DM2."
29518575,"Predictive , Preventive and Personalized Medicine ( PPPM ) manages and integrates these data to apply personalized , preventive , and therapeutic approaches."
29518575,"This is significant because there is an emerging need for establishing channels for communication and personalized consultation between systems research and precision medicine , as the medicine of the future."
20425575,Significant benefits for diabetes prevention and management have been observed with vegetarian and especially vegan diets.
20425575,"This article reviews observational studies and intervention trials on such diets , and discusses their efficacy , nutritional adequacy , acceptability , and sustainability."
20425575,"Research to date has demonstrated that a low - fat , plant - based nutritional approach improves control of weight , glycemia , and cardiovascular risk."
20425575,"These studies have also shown that carefully planned vegan diets can be more nutritious than diets based on more conventional diet guidelines , with an acceptability that is comparable with that of other therapeutic regimens."
20425575,Current intervention guidelines from professional organizations offer support for this approach.
20425575,Vegetarian and vegan diets present potential advantages in managing type 2 diabetes that merit the attention of individuals with diabetes and their caregivers.
26111830,"Background / objective : The global increase in childhood obesity has in some countries been followed by an increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) ; however , the prevalence of T2DM among Danish children and adolescents is currently unknown."
26111830,"The aims of this cross-sectional study were to determine the prevalence of T2DM in children and adolescents in Denmark together with status on treatment , metabolic control , and late diabetic complications."
26111830,"Methods : Individuals were identified in the Danish Registry for Diabetes in Children and Adolescents ( DanDiabKids ) , and clinical information regarding these was obtained from the respective pediatric departments."
26111830,"Results : In total , seven young individuals ( three boys ) with T2DM were identified , according to the American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) / International Society of Pediatric and Adolecent Diabetes ( ISPAD ) guidelines , leading to a prevalence of T2DM at 0.6 / 100 000 inhabitants in Denmark."
26111830,Only three of the patients had hyperglycemic symptoms at diagnosis.
26111830,One boy was overweight and six were obese ( two boys ).
26111830,"Currently , no patients fulfill the treatment target of glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) < 7.0 % ( 53 mmol / mol ) according to the guidelines for treatment of diabetes."
26111830,"Conclusions : In 2014 , there is no increasing prevalence of T2DM in children and adolescents in Denmark."
26111830,"Nevertheless , the current treatment regimen is not satisfying , as none of the patients truly fulfill the treatment target."
15751600,The medical community faces an emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2 ) in children and adolescents with a disproportionate increase among certain ethnic groups.
15751600,DM2 represents one arm of the metabolic syndrome and parallels an increasing prevalence of obesity.
15751600,"The metabolic syndrome includes insulin resistance , hyperlipidemia , and hypertension with a consequent risk of early cardiovascular disease."
15751600,"Thus , treatment of DM2 and the metabolic syndrome poses a challenge for pediatric endocrinologists and represents a huge public health issue."
15751600,This review presents information about treatment of childhood DM2 with emphasis on indications for the use of insulin in management and normalization of blood glucose.
28326652,"China is gradually taking its place as one of the world 's economic giants and concurrently learning to cope with the burden of diseases that are more common in the developed world , such as paediatric type 2 diabetes mellitus."
28326652,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been recently observed among children and adolescents in China ; hence , there is a lack of information about the incidence , prevalence , pathogenesis , and pathophysiology of the disease."
28326652,"Diagnosis , treatment , and management have been standardized to a large degree , but there is still a need for data regarding optimal management protocols and how to achieve the best control over current state of the disease."
28326652,"The objective of this review is to consolidate the available information about paediatric diabetes , with a focus on the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Chinese youth."
28326652,"Here we emphasize the prevention strategies and have included literature with respect to pathogenesis , diagnosis , and treatment published in English and Chinese within the past 10 years."
24072477,Research on the role of behavior change as an efficacious intervention for adults with type 2 diabetes is evolving.
24072477,"Searching PubMed and Ovid Medline , we identified and reviewed primarily randomized controlled trials from 2010 to 2013 of adults managing type 2 diabetes without insulin."
24072477,All studies are evaluated in terms of the rigor of their design and their impact on glycosylated hemoglobin.
24072477,"The most efficacious interventions appear to be low - carbohydrate / glycemic load diets , combined aerobic and resistance training , and self - monitoring of blood glucose , which educates patients about the impact of their food selections and physical activity on their blood glucose."
24026917,Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is a chronic progressive disease with high morbidity and mortality rates.
24026917,"Previously an adult onset disease , it is now being diagnosed more and more in childhood and adolescence."
24026917,"Lately , Asia has become the epicenter of this epidemic."
24026917,Childhood T2DM is a new challenge for the pediatrician.
24026917,"Due to similarities in presentation , children may initially be misdiagnosed with Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM )."
24026917,"Most oral anti-diabetic agents have not been approved for use in adolescents , and there is a concern for safety of their use."
24026917,"Lifestyle intervention is difficult to conduct , and adherence to recommendations is lower in adolescents than in adults with T2DM."
24026917,"Higher incidence and early onset of co-morbidities , with lack of long term outcomes data make the management problematic."
24026917,"In many communities , due to a shortage of specialists , general practitioners will treat children with T2DM."
24026917,Guidelines cited in this review are designed to help with the diagnostic process and management.
15611492,Diabetes mellitus is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States ; 17 million people are affected.
15611492,Liver disease is one of the leading causes of death in persons with type 2 diabetes.
15611492,The standardized mortality rate for death from liver disease is greater than that for cardiovascular disease.
15611492,The spectrum of liver disease in type 2 diabetes ranges from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
15611492,The incidence of hepatitis C and acute liver failure is also increased.
15611492,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now considered part of the metabolic syndrome , and , with alcohol and hepatitis C , is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States."
15611492,"Weight reduction and exercise are the mainstays of treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , but there are promising results with the new thiazolidinediones ( pioglitazone and rosiglitazone ) as well as metformin and 3 - hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors."
22424044,"Type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) is an incompletely understood chronic , progressive multifactorial disease with insulin resistance and decreased β - cell function playing dominant roles in its genesis."
22424044,The worldwide incidence of the disease is rapidly increasing to pandemic proportions.
22424044,"The increase in incidence of T2DM is attributable to changes in lifestyle , diet and obesity , but other causes remain to be defined."
22424044,"The disease is a major cause of early mortality due to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , and is the leading cause of blindness , leg amputations , and chronic renal disease."
22424044,Hyperglycemia inT2DM becomes manifest once insulin secretion is no longer adequate for the metabolic demands of the individual.
22424044,The approach to glycemic management of the disease is increasingly based on understanding the underlying pathophysiology.
22424044,Efforts to maintain and preserve β - cell function during the earlier phases of the disease may have important implications in prevention of subsequent complications of T2DM.
22424044,"Finally , the approach to glycemic management of the disease should be individualized by considering the psycho - socio - economic condition of each patient , and glycemic targets should reflect presence of comorbid conditions , age of the patient , the stage of their disease in terms of duration , presence of macro - and micro-vascular complications , and propensity for severe hypoglycemia."
14502096,"Increasing levels of obesity , arising from energy - rich diets and sedentary lifestyles , are driving a global pandemic of type 2 diabetes."
14502096,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide is set to increase from its present level of 150 million , to 225 million by the end of the decade and to as many as 300 million by 2025."
14502096,"Shocking as they are , these figures represent only clinically diagnosed diabetes , and many more cases of diabetes remain undiagnosed and untreated."
14502096,"In addition , up to one - quarter of western populations have impaired glucose tolerance or the dysmetabolic syndrome , which are considered to represent pre-diabetic states."
14502096,"Type 2 diabetes is appearing increasingly in children and adolescents , and the frequency of diagnosis of paediatric type 2 diabetes is outstripping that of type 1 diabetes in some areas."
14502096,"The long - term complications associated with type 2 diabetes carries a crushing burden of morbidity and mortality , and most type 2 diabetic patients die prematurely from a cardiovascular event."
14502096,"Diabetic patients are more than twice as costly to manage as non-diabetic patients , due mainly to the high costs associated with management of diabetic complications."
14502096,"Indeed , diabetes care already accounts for about 2 - 7 % of the total national health care budgets of western European countries."
14502096,Controlling the type 2 diabetes epidemic will require changes to the structure of healthcare delivery.
14502096,"Well - resourced interventions will be required , with effective co-ordination between all levels of government , health care agencies , multidisciplinary health care teams , professional organisations , and patient advocacy groups."
14502096,"Above all , intervention is needed today."
12643175,"Type 2 diabetes is strongly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , a spectrum of liver damage that ranges from relatively benign hepatic steatosis to potentially fatal cirrhosis."
12643175,"The severities of insulin resistance and liver damage parallel each other , with the greatest prevalence of cirrhosis occurring in cirrhotics."
12643175,"However , it is unknown whether one of these conditions causes the other , or if both are consequences of another process."
12643175,Experimental evidence suggests that both insulin resistance and NAFLD result from a chronic inflammatory state.
12643175,"The mechanisms driving this chronic inflammation are unknown but might include the egress of products from intestinal bacteria into the portal blood , liver , and systemic circulation to trigger a sustained inflammatory cytokine response in genetically susceptible individuals."
12643175,More research is needed to evaluate this hypothesis and to determine the benefits of treatments that interrupt this pathogenic cascade.
17852797,"Chronic hyperglycaemia ( e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and prediabetes ) in humans is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular ( CV ) complications , and , vice versa , the presence of CV complications ( e.g. myocardial infarction , stroke or intermittent claudication ) among patients heightens the risk of T2DM or prediabetes."
17852797,"In both cases ( i.e. chronic hyperglycaemia and CV complications ) , significant diagnostic and treatment challenges resulting from a broad range of factors may serve as barriers to reducing the deleterious societal impact of T2DM and prediabetes."
17852797,These challenges often include clinicians : failing to intervene early and aggressively enough among patients with T2DM to achieve CV risk factor control ; failing to efficaciously identify T2DM patients with already established CV complications ; and failing proactively to assess individuals at high risk for T2DM.
17852797,"This review discusses the apparent symbiosis between CV disease and T2DM , with a focus on identifying patients with established T2DM or at risk for T2DM ; traditional and novel risk factors and markers for CV disease in T2DM ; challenges related to diagnosing CV disease in T2DM ; and organization of T2DM care in order to prevent CV complications."
17852797,"These are issues that require attention because identifying patients at high risk for T2DM can halt or reduce their further glycaemic deterioration if addressed properly , and because novel markers and non-invasive tests could be applied in patients with T2DM as a means of detecting and possibly treating unrecognized CV disease in time."
17852797,"Furthermore , several approaches for T2DM care can be effective in controlling the CV risk factors contributing to CV complications."
30468403,The onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is strongly associated with obesity and subsequent perturbations in immuno - metabolic responses.
30468403,"To understand the complexity of these systemic changes and better monitor the health status of people at risk , validated clinical biomarkers are needed."
30468403,"Omics technologies are increasingly applied to measure the interplay of genes , proteins and metabolites in biological systems , which is imperative in understanding molecular mechanisms of disease and selecting the best possible molecular biomarkers for clinical use."
30468403,"Areas covered : This review describes the complex onset of T2DM , the contribution of obesity and adipose tissue inflammation to the T2DM disease mechanism , and the output of current biomarker strategies."
30468403,"A new biomarker approach is described that combines published and new self - generated data to merge multiple - omes ( i.e. genome , proteome , metabolome etc. ) toward understanding of mechanism of disease on the individual level and design multiparameter biomarker panels that drive significant impacts on personalized healthcare."
30468403,Expert commentary : We here propose an approach to use cross-omics analyses to contextualize published biomarker data and better understand molecular mechanisms of health and disease.
30468403,This will improve the current and future innovation gaps in translation of discovered putative biomarkers to clinically applicable biomarker tests.
23551885,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) continues to skyrocket across the industrialized world leading to soaring medical costs , reduced quality of life and increased mortality rates."
23551885,"Therefore , a more firm understanding of the development of the disease and effective , low cost therapies for prevention and treatment are desperately needed."
23551885,"Accumulating evidence suggests that increased sedentary time ( i.e. ' sitting time ' ) combined with reduced physical activity levels , plays both a major role in the development of T2D and may contribute to the worsening of the condition after diagnosis."
23551885,"In this review , we cover these topics and use current scientific evidence to support our belief that ' type 2 diabetes sits in a chair '."
23551885,We also discuss a relatively new question that has yet to be examined : Would reducing sitting time be an effective treatment for T2D?
23625197,"Since their approval , thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) have been used extensively as insulin - sensitizers for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM )."
23625197,Activation of peroxisomal proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ ) nuclear receptors by TZDs leads to a vast spectrum of metabolic and antiinflammatory effects.
23625197,"In the past decade , clinicians and scientists across the fields of metabolism , diabetes , liver disease ( NAFLD ) , atherosclerosis , inflammation , infertility , and even cancer have had high hopes about the potential for TZDs to treat many of these diseases."
23625197,"However , an increasing awareness about undesirable "" off - target "" effects of TZDs have made us rethink their role and be more cautious about the long - term benefits and risks related to their use."
23625197,"This review examines the most relevant work on the benefits and risks associated with TZD treatment , with a focus on the only PPARγ agonist currently available ( pioglitazone ) , aiming to offer the reader a balanced overview about the current and future role of TZDs in the management of insulin - resistant states and T2DM."
14659011,"Genome - wide studies of transcription in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic patients have identified coordinated changes in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation , and have underlined the central role of the oxidative - phosphorylation regulator , PCG1alpha."
14659011,These findings help unravel the complex pathogenesis and inheritance of polygenic type 2 diabetes mellitus.
27231735,Type 2 diabetes is increasing in prevalence at a worrying rate and has been exacerbated by the worldwide obesity epidemic.
27231735,The number of people in the UK diagnosed with type 2 diabetes has soared by 60 % in the past 10 years.
27231735,"Type 2 diabetes is a very serious condition , with significant associated risks , and is the leading cause of avoidable macro - and microvascular complications."
27231735,"Health professionals have a key role in enabling and optimising person - centred approaches , educating and augmenting the essential skills every person , whatever his or her individual circumstances , requires for the successful self - management of this lifelong condition."
27231735,"This article reviews approaches to care for the management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes , which includes optimising person - centred targets , promoting individualised care , minimising the risk of complications and promoting education from diagnosis onwards."
2016,Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) increases in prevalence in the elderly.
2016,There is evidence for significant muscle loss and accelerated cognitive impairment in older adults with T2DM ; these comorbidities are critical features of frailty.
2016,"In the early stages of T2DM , insulin sensitivity can be improved by a "" healthy "" diet."
2016,Management of insulin resistance by diet in people over 65 years of age should be carefully re-evaluated because of the risk for falling due to hypoglycaemia.
2016,"To date , an optimal dietary programme for older adults with insulin resistance and T2DM has not been described."
2016,The use of biomarkers to identify those at risk for T2DM will enable clinicians to offer early dietary advice that will delay onset of disease and of frailty.
2016,Here we have used an in silico literature search for putative novel biomarkers of T2DM risk and frailty.
2016,"We suggest that plasma bilirubin , plasma , urinary DPP4 - positive microparticles and plasma pigment epithelium - derived factor merit further investigation as predictive biomarkers for T2DM and frailty risk in older adults."
2016,Bilirubin is screened routinely in clinical practice.
2016,Measurement of specific microparticle frequency in urine is less invasive than a blood sample so is a good choice for biomonitoring.
2016,"Future studies should investigate whether early dietary changes , such as increased intake of whey protein and micronutrients that improve muscle function and insulin sensitivity , affect biomarkers and can reduce the longer term complication of frailty in people at risk for T2DM."
21785581,Mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress are closely associated with β - cell dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance.
21785581,"Thus , each of these factors contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM )."
21785581,The accumulated evidence reveals structural and functional communications between mitochondria and the ER.
21785581,It is now well established that ER stress causes apoptotic cell death by disturbing mitochondrial Ca ( 2 + ) homeostasis.
21785581,"In addition , recent studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction causes ER stress."
21785581,"In this paper , we summarize the roles that mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress play in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM."
21785581,Structural and functional communications between mitochondria and the ER are also discussed.
21785581,"Finally , we focus on recent findings supporting the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction and the subsequent induction of ER stress play important roles in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM."
21778617,"Osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) are now prevalent in aging and westernized societies , and adversely affect the health of the elderly people by causing fractures and vascular complications , respectively."
21778617,Recent experimental and clinical studies show that both disorders are etiologically related to each other through the actions of osteocalcin and adiponectin.
21778617,"Meta - analyses of multiple clinical studies show that hip fracture risk of T2DM patients is increased to 1.4 to 1.7-folds , although BMD of the patients is not diminished."
21778617,"Vertebral fracture risk of T2DM patients is also increased , and BMD is not useful for assessing its risk."
21778617,These findings suggest that bone fragility in T2DM depends on bone quality deterioration rather than bone mass reduction.
21778617,"Thus , surrogate markers are needed to replace the insensitivity of BMD in assessing fracture risks of T2DM patients."
21778617,"Markers related to advanced glycation end products as well as insulin - like growth factor - I may be such candidates , because these substances were experimentally shown to modulate bone quality in DM."
21778617,"In practice , it is important for physicians to assess fracture risk in T2DM patients by evaluating prior VFs and fracture histories using spine X-ray and interview , respectively , until the usefulness of surrogate markers is established."
2406178,Type 2 ( non-insulin-dependent ) diabetes mellitus is the major form of the disease in all societies.
2406178,Its public health impact appears to be increasing and the greatest genetic predisposition to the disease is encountered in developing communities.
2406178,The reduction or elimination of disease in whole populations is a fundamental goal in public health.
2406178,"Whilst several factors are associated with the development of Type 2 diabetes , it is not clear how they cause the disease , if indeed they do , nor whether they act in the same way in all populations."
2406178,Risk factors may be true determinants of a disease but alternatively they may be associated with its occurrence only by virtue of an innocent relationship with the true causes.
2406178,"Furthermore , known risk factors usually explain only a small proportion of any chronic disease."
2406178,The role of risk factors in disease causation is therefore of fundamental importance in considering disease prevention.
2406178,Two alternative strategies for prevention of disease in populations have been proposed.
2406178,"The population strategy seeks to remove the causes of disease in communities as a whole , whilst the high - risk strategy aims to identify subjects at increased risk , and to intervene selectively."
2406178,The population approach should be tried and carefully evaluated in selected communities at above - average risk of several noncommunicable diseases.
2406178,"However , certain epidemiological features of Type 2 diabetes , including the distributional characteristics of glycaemia and the complications of hyperglycaemia , the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors in the diabetic subpopulation , as well as uncertainties over the causal nature of known risk factors , suggest that a high - risk approach to prevention is also appropriate."
2406178,( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23551885,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) continues to skyrocket across the industrialized world leading to soaring medical costs , reduced quality of life and increased mortality rates."
23551885,"Therefore , a more firm understanding of the development of the disease and effective , low cost therapies for prevention and treatment are desperately needed."
23551885,"Accumulating evidence suggests that increased sedentary time ( i.e. ' sitting time ' ) combined with reduced physical activity levels , plays both a major role in the development of T2D and may contribute to the worsening of the condition after diagnosis."
23551885,"In this review , we cover these topics and use current scientific evidence to support our belief that ' type 2 diabetes sits in a chair '."
23551885,We also discuss a relatively new question that has yet to be examined : Would reducing sitting time be an effective treatment for T2D?
31640691,Background : Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) is a chronic disease closely related to personal life style.
31640691,"Therefore , achieving effective self - management is one of the most important ways to control it."
31640691,"There is evidence that social support can help to improve the self - management ability of patients with T2DM , but which social support is more effective has been rarely explored."
31640691,"The purpose of this study is to construct an integrated model to analyze which social support has more significant impact on self - management of T2DM , and provide reasonable suggestions to health care providers on how to effectively play the role of social support."
31640691,Methods : We established a social support indicator evaluation system and proposed an integrated model that combines ANP ( Analytical Network Process ) and CRITIC ( CRiteria Importance through Intercriteria Correlation ) methods to evaluate the impact of social support on T2DM self - management from both subjective and objective perspectives.
31640691,The weights calculated by the model will serve as the basis for us to judge the importance of different social support indicators.
31640691,"Results : Informational support ( weighting 49.26 % ) is the most important criteria , followed by tangible support ( weighting 39.24 % ) and emotional support ( weighting 11.51 % )."
31640691,"Among 11 sub-criteria , guidance ( weighting 23.05 % ) and feedback ( weighting 14.68 % ) are two most relevant with T2DM self - management."
31640691,This result provides ideas and evidence for health care providers on how to offer more effective social support.
31640691,"Conclusion : To our knowledge , this is the first study in which Multi-Criteria Decision Making ( MCDM ) tools , specifically ANP and CRITIC , are used to evaluate the impact of social support on improving self - management of type 2 diabetes."
31640691,The study suggests that incorporating two sub-indicators of guidance and feedback into the diabetes care programs may have great potential to improve T2DM self - management and further control patient blood glucose and reduce complications.
15315864,"As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide , there is an enhanced need for effective disease management."
15315864,Type 2 diabetes is managed through a stepwise program of intensive therapy that consists of lifestyle modifications and sequential addition of oral antihyperglycemic agents and insulin as necessary.
15315864,Successful implementation of this approach lessens the microvascular complications of the disease and promotes a lifestyle that may reduce macrovascular complications and comorbidities.
15315864,"Because of the progressive pancreatic beta - cell failure that causes hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes , many people with type 2 diabetes will ultimately require insulin for disease management."
15315864,Insulin may be used alone or in combination with oral agents to achieve glycemic control with a minimum of side effects.
15315864,"Although disease management regimens must be tailored to the needs of the individual with type 2 diabetes , the health care provider should always employ an aggressive , treat - to - target strategy to lower hyperglycemia and lessen diabetes - related risk factors."
32879331,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is one common chronic disease caused by insulin secretion disorder that often leads to severe outcomes and even death due to complications , among which coronary heart disease ( CHD ) represents the most common and severe one."
32879331,"Given a huge number of T2DM patients , it is thus increasingly important to identify the ones with high risks of CHD complication but the quantitative method is still not available."
32879331,"Here , we first curated a dataset of 1,273 T2DM patients including 304 and 969 ones with or without CHD , respectively."
32879331,We then trained an artificial intelligence ( AI ) model using randomly selected 4/5 of the dataset and use the rest data to validate the performance of the model.
32879331,The result showed that the model achieved an AUC of 0.77 ( fivefold cross-validation ) on the training dataset and 0.80 on the testing dataset.
32879331,"To further confirm the performance of the presented model , we recruited 1,253 new T2DM patients as totally independent testing dataset including 200 and 1,053 ones with or without CHD."
32879331,And the model achieved an AUC of 0.71.
32879331,"In addition , we implemented a model to quantitatively evaluate the risk contribution of each feature , which is thus able to present personalized guidance for specific individuals."
32879331,"Finally , an online web server for the model was built."
32879331,"This study presented an AI model to determine the risk of T2DM patients to develop to CHD , which has potential value in providing early warning personalized guidance of CHD risk for both T2DM patients and clinicians."
32198647,"Purpose of review : Genetic , socioeconomic and clinical features vary considerably among individuals with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) influencing disease development , progression and response to therapy."
32198647,"Although a patient - centred approach to pharmacologic therapy of T2D is widely recommended , patients are often treated similarly , irrespective of the differences that may affect therapeutic response."
32198647,Addressing the heterogeneity of T2D is a major task of diabetes research to lower the high rate of treatment failure as well as to reduce the risk of long - term complications.
32198647,Recent findings : A pathophysiology - based clustering system seems the most promising to help in the stratification of diabetes in terms of complication risk and response to treatment.
32198647,This urges for clinical studies looking at novel biomarkers related to the different metabolic pathways of T2D and able to inform about the therapeutic cluster of each patient.
32198647,"Here , we review the main settings of diabetes heterogeneity , to what extent it has been already addressed and the current gaps in knowledge towards a personalized therapeutic approach that considers the distinctive features of each patient."
16466601,Objective : To provide an overview of the incidence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents and provide direction for clinicians who care for children and adolescents.
16466601,Research design and method : The data presented in this review were obtained from published literature and abstracts presented at scientific meetings.
16466601,"Clinical trials and review articles were identified using the search terms ' metabolic syndrome ' , ' type 2 diabetes mellitus ' , ' children ' , and ' adolescents ' in a MEDLINE search from 1995 - 2005."
16466601,"Additionally , the bibliographies of the identified articles were reviewed."
16466601,Results : Type 2 diabetes is rising rapidly in children and adolescents worldwide.
16466601,"Changing a child 's living environment to include physical activity , and a well balanced , low fat , high fiber diet , are important for the maintenance of a desirable body weight and improving insulin sensitivity."
16466601,"Maintaining euglycemia with metformin , sulfonylureas , thiazolinediones , and insulin is recommended."
16466601,Effective treatment of co-morbid problems such as hypertension and dyslipidemia can decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications.
16466601,Conclusions : The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children will continue to rise until effective measures are taken to prevent obesity in this age group.
16466601,"Ensuring that children have a well - balanced low fat , high fiber , diet , combined with physical activity , will promote weight loss or maintenance , improve insulin sensitivity , and decrease the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease."
16466601,Pharmacologic therapy is recommended for children who are unable to achieve satisfactory glycemic control through physical activity and diet.
11129120,"Results from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study showed that intensive treatment of type 2 ( non-insulin-dependent ) diabetes mellitus , with sulphonylureas or insulin , significantly reduced microvascular complications but did not have a significant effect on macrovascular complications after 10 years."
11129120,Insulin resistance plays a key role in type 2 diabetes mellitus and is linked to a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors.
11129120,Optimal treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus should aim to improve insulin resistance and the associated cardiovascular risk factors in addition to achieving glycaemic control.
11129120,Treatment with sulphonylureas or exogenous insulin improves glycaemic control by increasing insulin supplies rather than reducing insulin resistance.
11129120,Metformin and the recently introduced thiazolidinediones have beneficial effects on reducing insulin resistance as well as providing glycaemic control.
11129120,"There is evidence that , like metformin , thiazolidinediones also improve cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidaemia and fibrinolysis."
11129120,Whether these differences will translate into clinical benefit remains to be seen.
11129120,The thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have been available in the US since 1999 ( with pioglitazone also being available in Japan ).
11129120,Both products are now available to physicians in Europe.
12891055,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pediatric population is now a public health problem.
12891055,It represents 8 to 45 % of all diabetes reported among children and adolescents.
12891055,"Concurrently , childhood obesity has become an epidemic in the United States."
12891055,Epidemiologic risk factors and diagnostic criteria have largely been established : The incidence of type 2 diabetes increases with age and obesity.
12891055,Children and adolescents diagnosed with type 2 diabetes usually have a first - or second - degree relative with the disorder.
12891055,Familial clustering and twin studies have suggested a genetic component for type 2 diabetes.
12891055,"However , the molecular mechanisms that promote diabetes in susceptible individuals , the best treatment plans , and methods of prevention of this disorder are not yet established."
25453300,"This review describes the effect of type 2 diabetes on fat mass , fat distribution , and lean mass , and changes in these parameters , in older adults , focusing on observational studies."
25453300,"Studies show that type 2 diabetes is associated with an unfavorable body composition characterized by more visceral fat , less thigh subcutaneous fat , and more fat infiltration in the muscle compared with persons without the disease."
25453300,Longitudinal studies found an accelerated decline in muscle mass in older persons with type 2 diabetes.
25453300,"Studies are needed to examine the consequences of these changes in body composition on physical functioning , morbidity , and mortality risk."
16208307,The prevalence of diabetes is increasing in epidemic proportion worldwide.
16208307,"Because of the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease , it is becoming a major burden for the health care system."
16208307,"With a better understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes , the concept of primary prevention has emerged."
16208307,A number of studies demonstrated that both lifestyle modification program and pharmacological interventions in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) can prevent or delay the progression to diabetes.
16208307,The Diabetes Prevention Study ( DPS ) and the Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) convincingly showed that an intensive lifestyle modification program is highly effective in decreasing the risk of diabetes in a high risk population ( risk reduction of 58 % ).
16208307,Four other smaller studies have made similar observations.
16208307,The DPP study showed that metformin can reduced the risk of diabetes by 31 % in subjects with IGT.
16208307,The STOP - NIDDM trial confirmed the efficacy of acarbose in decreasing the risk of diabetes by 36 % in similar high risk population.
16208307,The TRIPOD study showed that troglitazone can reduce the incidence of diabetes by 55 % in Hispanic women with a history of gestational diabetes.
16208307,"And more recently , the XENDOS study showed that in very obese population on intensive lifestyle modification program , xenical treatment was associated with a 37 % reduced incidence of diabetes compared to placebo."
16208307,Three studies suggested that bariatric surgery in morbidly obese subjects with or without IGT can reduce the incidence of diabetes to near zero.
16208307,Eight of 10 studies showed that treatment with inhibitors of the renin - angiotensin aldosterone system in high risk population for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) were associated with a significant reduction in the subsequent development of diabetes as a secondary outcome.
16208307,The WOSCOPS study and the HERS study examined the effect of pravastatin and estrogen / progestin respectively on cardiovascular events and observed that these pharmacological interventions were associated with a 30 % and 35 % reduction in the incidence of diabetes as secondary outcome.
16208307,"There are 3 major trials currently in progress examining the effect of rosiglitazone / ramipril ( the DREAM study ) , nateglinide / valsartan ( the NAVIGATOR study ) and pioglitazone ( the ACT NOW study ) on the development of diabetes in IGT subjects as a primary outcome."
16208307,"We also have 3 studies studying the prevention of diabetes as secondary outcomes : the ONTARGET - TRANSCEND study examining telmisartan with or without ramipril , and the ORIGIN study testing glargine insulin / omega 3."
16208307,The evidence is overwelming - diabetes can be prevented or delayed in high risk population through lifestyle modification or pharmacological interventions.
16208307,This new information now has to be translated in the real world into well defined strategies for screening and treating high risk population.
16208307,Prevention of the disease is our only chance to alleviate the ever growing burden of diabetes mellitus in the world.
29775677,Aims : Partners and spouses have an important role in supporting healthy self - care in adults with Type 2 diabetes.
29775677,"While evidence has shown that the beliefs held by people with diabetes influence emotional wellbeing , little is known about the long - term impact of partners ' illness beliefs on diabetes distress."
29775677,Methods : Persons with Type 2 diabetes ( pwt2d ) and their partners completed a questionnaire at baseline ( N = 75 couples ) and 12 months later ( N = 45 couples ).
29775677,"Measures included demographic / clinical parameters , the Revised Illness Perception questionnaire , and the Diabetes Distress Scale."
29775677,A repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine change in measures over time.
29775677,Multiple regression and moderation analysis were used to explore the indirect influence of partners beliefs on diabetes distress at baseline and follow - up.
29775677,Results : Illness perceptions and diabetes distress in pwt2d and partners did not change overtime.
29775677,"Partners ' beliefs about the controllability , chronicity , and predictability of symptoms of diabetes moderated the relationship between the corresponding pwt2d beliefs and diabetes distress."
29775677,These indirect effects were observed across both time points.
29775677,"Conclusions : Conflicting illness perceptions about the controllability and chronicity of diabetes , and congruous negative perceptions about diabetes symptoms among couples sustain distress overtime."
29775677,Targeting the beliefs of couples to improve communication and understanding may reduce diabetes distress.
18035959,The growing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes with its high morbidity and excess mortality is imposing a heavy burden on healthcare systems.
18035959,"Because of the magnitude of the problem , obviating diabetes has been a long - standing dream."
18035959,"In the last decade , a number of intervention strategies have been shown to be effective for the prevention of diabetes in high - risk populations with prediabetes."
18035959,"Seven studies have now confirmed that lifestyle modifications , including weight - reducing diets and exercise programs , are very effective in precluding or delaying Type 2 diabetes in high - risk populations with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT )."
18035959,Two major trials are the Diabetes Prevention Study ( n = 522 ) from Finland and the Diabetes Prevention Program ( n = 3234 ) from the US.
18035959,Both studies have shown that intensive lifestyle intervention could reduce the progression of IGT to diabetes by 58 %.
18035959,"Furthermore , four currently - available drugs have been established as being effective in preventing diabetes in subjects with prediabetes."
18035959,The Diabetes Prevention Program revealed that metformin 850 mg b.i.d. reduced the risk of diabetes by 31 %.
18035959,The STOP - NIDDM ( Study To Prevent Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ) trial ( n = 1429 ) showed that acarbose 100 mg t.i.d. with meals decreased the incidence of diabetes by 36 % when the diagnosis was based on 2 oral glucose tolerance tests.
18035959,"The XENDOS ( Xenical in the Prevention of Diabetes in Obese Subjects ) study examined the use of orlistat , an antiobesity drug , as an adjunct to an intensive lifestyle modification program in obese non-diabetic subjects."
18035959,Orlistat treatment resulted in a 37 % decline in the development of diabetes.
18035959,"More recently , the DREAM ( Diabetes Reduction Assessment with Ramipril and Rosiglitazone Medication ) study ( n = 5269 ) demonstrated that rosiglitazone at 8 mg once / day in subjects with prediabetes ( IGT and / or impaired fasting glucose ) was effective in reducing the risk of diabetes by 60 %."
18035959,It can be concluded that Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed through lifestyle modifications and / or pharmacologic interventions.
18035959,This is a fact.
10520444,Several new pharmacological agents attempt to correct abnormalities in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
10520444,The availability of agents with different mechanisms of action and side - effect profiles permits the design of individualized regimens that address the various pathophysiologic abnormalities.
17293741,Type 2 diabetes mellitus has quickly become a worldwide epidemic with no evidence of eradication in the near future.
17293741,Its effect on the vasculature often leads to cardiovascular disease with subsequent morbidity and mortality.
17293741,This article is the result of an extensive literature review in which data from multiple clinical trials is summarized to guide diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
17293741,Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disease that requires meticulous attention from healthcare providers and patients.
17293741,All healthcare providers need to be responsible for the assessment and monitoring of risk factors associated with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.
25629355,The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) in youth has increased dramatically over the past decades.
25629355,"The literature also suggests that the progression from an impaired glucose tolerance state to established T2DM is more rapid in youth , compared to adults."
25629355,"The presence of significant cardiovascular complications in youth with T2DM , including cardiac , macrovascular , and microvascular remodeling , is another major issue in this younger cohort and poses a significant threat to the healthcare system."
25629355,"However , this issue is only now emerging as a major public health concern , with few data to support optimal treatment targets and strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk in youth with T2DM."
25629355,"Accordingly , the purpose of this minireview is to better understand the cardiovascular complications in youth with T2DM."
25629355,"We briefly describe the pathophysiology from youth studies , including oxidative stress , inflammation , renin - angiotensin aldosterone system , and epigenetics , which link T2DM and CVD."
25629355,We also describe the literature concerning the early signs of CVD in youth and potential treatment options to reduce cardiovascular risk.
32167814,Background : Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diseases worldwide.
32167814,The demands on health services are rising as more people are diagnosed with the condition.
32167814,"In order to meet this demand , eHealth systems are increasingly being integrated into nursing care."
32167814,"Methods : Between November 2018 and February 2019 , a literature search was carried out in the databases PubMed and CINAHL."
32167814,"Results : Twenty articles were found on nurses ' use of eHealth systems , the majority with patients with diabetes."
32167814,"From this research , it would seem that eHealth systems have had a proven positive influence on patients ' state of health and understanding of therapy."
32167814,Subjectively perceived communication with the nursing staff also improved.
32167814,Problems can arise in the implementation phase.
32167814,"Conclusion : In the future , increasingly , nurses will have to integrate eHealth systems into the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes."
32167814,It is important that nurses understand such systems in order to guarantee a sustainable and successful implementation.
12211961,The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing in children and is reaching epidemic proportions in some western countries.
12211961,"Sue Howdle and Terry Wilkin examine the extent of the problem , the disease process , screening , prevention and management of type 2 diabetes."
20956395,There is a need to simplify screening tests for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) so patients can be identified earlier and more efficiently.
20956395,"Glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) has been recommended by some international organisations as a diagnostic tool for detecting T2DM and impaired glucose regulation ( IGR , also termed prediabetes and includes impaired fasting glucose and / or impaired glucose tolerance )."
20956395,"The HbA1c cut - point of ≥ 6.5 % ( 48 mmol / mol ) has been selected as diagnostic for T2DM , while the cut - points for IGR are debated by the different international organisations : an International Expert Committee has suggested using HbA1c 6.0 - 6.4 % ( 42 - 46 mmol / mol ) ; however , the American Diabetes Association has recommended using HbA1c 5.7 - 6.4 % ( 39 - 46 mmol / mol )."
20956395,Some countries will adopt a new method of reporting HbA1c values in millimoles per mole ( mmol / mol ).
20956395,Use of HbA1c has some logistical advantages over using an oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ).
20956395,"As patients do not need to fast , appointments do not need to be limited to the morning."
20956395,The HbA1c result reflects longer term glycaemia and is less affected by recent physical / emotional stress.
20956395,"However , there is some debate as to whether HbA1c should replace fasting plasma glucose or the OGTT."
20956395,"As the two tests detect different people , some individuals with diabetes detected on OGTT will no longer be classified as having T2DM using HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % criteria."
20956395,"Furthermore , some medical conditions can result in HbA1c assay measurements not reflecting glycaemic control over the last 2 - 3 months ; these include haematological disorders , renal failure , and chronic excess alcohol consumption."
11979020,Type 2 diabetes is an increasing problem in children.
11979020,"Two decades ago it had been described only in selected groups , e.g. the Pima Indians."
11979020,"Childhood type 2 diabetes appears to be similar to the metabolic syndrome in adults and is characterized by obesity , hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance."
11979020,"It can present a diagnostic challenge in children , as they can present with diabetic ketoacidosis ; the measurement of autoantibodies and C - peptide levels may be helpful."
11979020,The logarithmic association between the risk of complications with increasing glycaemia which has been established for adults with type 2 diabetes is likely to hold true for children but the conclusions of trials in adults must be extrapolated with caution.
11979020,Little is known about the onset and progression of macrovascular disease in affected children but it is almost certain that they will develop an excess of premature cardiovascular disease.
11979020,"However , the importance of reducing glycaemia in younger adults with diabetes , in order to minimize the incidence of microvascular complications , has been unequivocally demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial ( DCCT )."
11979020,Diet and exercise have a major role to play in the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes in children as well as adults - the escalation of type 2 diabetes throughout the developed world is a major public health problem.
11979020,"Extrapolating data from adults , metformin appears to be the logical first - line treatment in children with type 2 diabetes ; sulphonylureas are also used but neither of these agents have been evaluated in trials in children and are not licensed for such use."
11979020,"With regard to other newer agents , it seems wise to use well - established drugs with a long track record and for which the long - term safety data are available."
16085165,The number of children and youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes has increased dramatically over the last decade.
16085165,Much still needs to be learned about why this epidemic is occurring presently with regard to other environmental factors that might promote insulin resistance and beta - cell failure.
16085165,"The TODAY trial will help to determine the best treatment strategies to improve glycemia , reduce complications , and ameliorate insulin resistance and beta - cell failure."
16085165,"As type 2 diabetes emerges as a worldwide public health problem , improved care for affected youth must be coupled with a focus on prevention."
19479186,Structured exercise is considered an important cornerstone to achieve good glycemic control and improve cardiovascular risk profile in Type 2 diabetes.
19479186,Current clinical guidelines acknowledge the therapeutic strength of exercise intervention.
19479186,"This paper reviews the wide pathophysiological problems associated with Type 2 diabetes and discusses the benefits of exercise therapy on phenotype characteristics , glycemic control and cardiovascular risk profile in Type 2 diabetes patients."
19479186,"Based on the currently available literature , it is concluded that Type 2 diabetes patients should be stimulated to participate in specifically designed exercise intervention programs."
19479186,More attention should be paid to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning as well as motivational factors to improve long - term treatment adherence and clinical efficacy.
19479186,More clinical research is warranted to establish the efficacy of exercise intervention in a more differentiated approach for Type 2 diabetes subpopulations within different stages of the disease and various levels of co-morbidity.
19331240,"Objectives : To estimate the age specific prevalence of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) in Greenland in 2008 , and to evaluate the influence of electronic database access on the quality of the clinical management of the disease."
19331240,"Study design : Observational and cross-sectional study , review of medical records and databases."
19331240,Methods : Data on T2DM patients were collected from each rural district in Greenland.
19331240,"Results : The number of patients with T2DM , their age and gender were collected from 15 out of 17 districts and from the outpatient clinic of internal medicine in Nuuk."
19331240,This sampling represents 90 % of the population in Greenland.
19331240,The prevalence among Greenlanders > or = 40 years old is 2.1 %.
19331240,The prevalence increased with age.
19331240,The quality in the management of T2DM based on process indicators is significantly higher in clinics with an electronic database than those without.
19331240,Conclusions : The prevalence of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus in Greenland is low.
19331240,"When compared with previous population - based surveys , this suggests that the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes is high , especially in the age group between 40 and 60."
19331240,"Consequently , the focus should be on identifying undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in this group."
19331240,The quality in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus seems to be improved by the use of an electronic database.
19331240,Implementation of databases in all the clinics in Greenland is desirable.
18426839,"Intervention should be sooner rather than later , even though exact costs and benefits areuncertain"
27430259,"Background : Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) who participate in diabetes management programs have been shown to have better glycemic control and slower disease progression , although program participation remains low."
27430259,"In the USA , increasing participation in diabetes management support programs may also directly impact provider reimbursement , as payments are increasingly based on patient - centered measures."
27430259,"However , little is known about factors that may enhance patient participation."
27430259,This study aimed at further understanding what is important in diabetes management support from the patients ' perspective and at assessing the utilization of various types of diabetes - management programs.
27430259,"Methods : A two - phase mixed - methods study was conducted of adult US members of PatientsLikeMe ® , an online research network of patients."
27430259,"Phase 1 comprised qualitative interviews with 10 individuals to inform the online survey 's contents , aided by literature review."
27430259,"During phase 2 , this online survey was completed by 294 participants who reported on their diabetes goals and preferences for T2DM self - management support programs."
27430259,"Results : The majority of the respondents were not participating in any program ( 65 % ) , but most had goals of improving diet ( 77 % ) , weight loss ( 71 % ) , and achieving stable blood glucose levels ( 71 % )."
27430259,"Among those currently participating in programs , clinic , hospital - based , or other health - care professional programs were the most commonly used ( 51 % )."
27430259,"The most preferred type of support was diet / weight - loss support ( 62 % ) , while doctors or nurses ( 61 % ) and dietitians ( 55 % ) were the most preferred sources of diabetes support."
27430259,Conclusions : The low participation in diabetes self - management programs revealed in this study underscores the need for strategies to improve patient engagement.
27430259,The results revealed support types and formats that patients with T2DM prefer and need.
27430259,These findings may help improve patient engagement by guiding the future design of more effective diabetes management support programs.
19393492,Background : Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
19393492,Sub-clinical systemic inflammation is often present in T2DM patients.
19393492,Systemic inflammation has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis.
19393492,"This review investigates the direct evidence present in literature for the effect of inflammation on atherosclerosis , specifically in the setting of T2DM."
19393492,Special emphasis is given to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis as well as intermediate and clinical cardiovascular endpoints.
19393492,The important role of deteriorated endothelial function in T2DM was excluded from the analysis.
19393492,Methods : Extensive literature searches were performed using the PubMed and Web of Science databases.
19393492,"Articles were identified , retrieved and accepted or excluded based on predefined criteria."
19393492,"Results : Substantial evidence was found for an important inflammatory component in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in T2DM , demonstrated by inflammatory changes in plaque characteristics and macrophage infiltration."
19393492,"Most epidemiologic studies found a correlation between inflammation markers and intermediate cardiovascular endpoints , especially intima - media thickness."
19393492,"Several , but not all clinical trials in T2DM found that reducing sub-clinical inflammation had a beneficial effect on intermediate endpoints."
19393492,"When regarding cardiovascular events however , current literature consistently indicates a strong relationship between inflammation and clinical endpoints in subjects with T2DM."
19393492,Conclusion : Current literature provides direct evidence for a contribution of inflammatory responses to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in T2DM.
19393492,The most consistent relation was observed between inflammation and clinical endpoints.
25604005,"Epidemiological studies indicate that risks of certain cancers are increased in individuals hospitalized for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , which may not be representative of the entire population of T2DM patients as most of them are treated in primary health cares."
25604005,"To examine the subsequent cancer risk in individuals with T2DM from hospitals and primary health cares , and in their siblings and spouses , standardized incidence ratios ( SIRs ) were used to assess systematically risks of 35 cancer sites / types in individuals with T2DM using a nationwide Swedish database covering the period 1964 through 2010."
25604005,Increased SIRs were recorded for 24 cancer sites / types in individuals with T2DM.
25604005,"The highest SIRs were for pancreatic cancer and liver cancer ( 2.98 and 2.43 , respectively )."
25604005,A decreased SIR was noted for prostate cancer.
25604005,"Five cancers showed increased SIRs during the whole follow - up period : colon , liver , pancreatic , endometrial and kidney cancers."
25604005,"T2DM patients in inpatient , outpatient and primary health care showed similar risk patterns."
25604005,"The overall SIRs for cancer in the siblings and spouses of individuals with T2DM were 0.97 and 1.01 , respectively."
25604005,The insulin users showed an overall increased risk of cancer.
25604005,"This study showed increased risks of 24 cancers in individuals with T2DM , but not in their siblings or spouses , suggesting that the profound metabolic disturbances of the underlying disease may explain the observed increases."
25604005,Further studies examining the endogenous and exogenous factors underlying these associations are needed.
15671192,Purpose : The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is increasing.
15671192,There is also concern that diabetes may be occurring at a greater frequency in youth and in young adults.
15671192,We describe US population trends in self - reported age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
15671192,Methods : We undertook a secondary analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) 1999 - 2000 and NHANES III ( 1988 - 1994 ).
15671192,"Both surveys are stratified , multistage probability samples targeting the civilian , noninstitutionalized US population , which allow calculation of population estimates."
15671192,We included adults aged 20 years and older.
15671192,We compared self - reported age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes between the 2 survey periods.
15671192,Results : The mean age at diagnosis decreased from 52.0 to 46.0 years ( P < .05 ).
15671192,Racial and ethnic differences in age at diagnosis found in 1988 to 1994 are no longer found in 1999 to 2000.
15671192,Conclusions : The age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus has decreased with time.
15671192,"This finding likely represents a combination of changing diagnostic criteria , improved physician recognition of diabetes , and increased public awareness."
15671192,Younger age at diagnosis may also reflect a true population trend of earlier onset of type 2 diabetes.
12410955,Objective : To study the relationship between the inheritable factor and environmental factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans.
12410955,Methods : A case - control study based on 154 type 2 diabetes mellitus and 130 healthy controls was carried out in Jiangsu Province in 1997.
12410955,"Results : The age , family history of diabetes mellitus , hypertension history , high waist / hip ratio ( WHR ) , high systolic blood pressure , huge fetus history , and the genotype of beta ( 3 ) - adrenergic receptor ( beta ( 3 ) - AR ) were the risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus ; while occupational physical activity was protective factor of type 2 diabetes mellitus."
12410955,"The risk for diabetes mellitus distinctly increased while genetic factor and obesity , beta ( 3 ) - AR mutation were coexisting."
27518283,"Many studies assessed the association between hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in later life , but contradictory findings were reported."
27518283,A systemic review and meta - analysis was carried out to elucidate type 2 diabetes mellitus risk in women with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.
27518283,"Pubmed , Embase , and Web of Science were searched for cohort or case - control studies on the association between hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus."
27518283,Random - effect model was used to pool risk estimates.
27518283,Bayesian meta - analysis was carried out to further estimate the type 2 diabetes mellitus risk associated with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.
27518283,Seventeen cohort or prospective matched case - control studies were finally included.
27518283,"Those 17 studies involved 2,984,634 women and 46,732 type 2 diabetes mellitus cases."
27518283,"Overall , hypertensive disorders during pregnancy were significantly correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk ( relative risk = 1.56 , 95 % confidence interval 1.21 - 2.01 , P = 0.001 )."
27518283,"Preeclampsia was significantly and independently correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk ( relative risk = 2.25 , 95 % confidence interval 1.73 - 2.90 , P < 0.001 )."
27518283,"In addition , gestational hypertension was also significantly and independently correlated with subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus risk ( relative risk = 2.06 , 95 % confidence interval 1.57 - 2.69 , P < 0.001 )."
27518283,The pooled estimates were not significantly altered in the subgroup analyses of studies on preeclampsia or gestational hypertension.
27518283,"Bayesian meta - analysis showed the relative risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus risk for individuals with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy , preeclampsia , and gestational hypertension were 1.59 ( 95 % credibility interval : 1.11 - 2.32 ) , 2.27 ( 95 % credibility interval : 1.67 - 2.97 ) , and 2.06 ( 95 % credibility interval : 1.41 - 2.84 ) , respectively."
27518283,Publication bias was not evident in the meta - analysis.
27518283,Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension are independently associated with substantially elevated risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in later life.
30024853,Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus [ T2DM ] is one of the leading causes for mortality.
30024853,"This study examined the role of an self - awareness based guided meditation practice , Cyclic Meditation [ CM ] on perceived stress , anxiety , depression , sleep and quality of life in T2DM patients."
30024853,Design A single arm pre-post design was used for the study.
30024853,"Setting The study was conducted in an auditorium for general public diagnosed with T2DM in Ernakulam , Kerala , India."
30024853,"Subjects Subjects were 30 T2DM patients , both male and female of age 50.12 ± 11.15 years and BMI 25.14 ± 4.37 Kg / m2 and not having a history of hospitalisation were randomly recruited for the study following advertisements in national dailies."
30024853,"Intervention Participants completed a supervised CM programs in the evenings , 5 days a week for 4 weeks , in addition to their regular medication."
30024853,"Measures Perceived stress , anxiety and depression were assessed with Perceived Stress Scale , State Anxiety Inventory and Beck 's depression inventory , respectively."
30024853,Sleep and quality of life were assessed with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and WHO - Quality of Life - BREF respectively.
30024853,"Analysis Changes in the outcome measures from baseline to 4 weeks were compared using paired "" t "" test."
30024853,"Results After 4 weeks , the quality of life and sleep scores increased 7.1 % [ p = 0.001 ] and 32.7 % [ p = 0.001 ] , respectively."
30024853,"The perceived stress , anxiety and depression reduced 26.1 % [ p = 0.001 ] , 16.01 % [ p = 0.003 ] and 37.63 % [ p = 0.006 ] as compared to their baseline reports."
30024853,The CM practice also reduced daytime dysfunction.
30024853,"Conclusions A guided self - awareness based meditation program was safe and effective in improving depression , anxiety , perceived stress and enhance sleep and quality of life in T2DM patients , which could be helpful in reducing the future complications of T2DM."
30024853,Mind management is essential along with medical management to achieve better clinical results.
10903125,"There is increasing epidemiological evidence in humans which associates low birthweight with later metabolic disorders , including insulin resistance and glucose intolerance."
10903125,"There is evidence that nutritional and hormonal factors ( e.g. maternal protein restriction , exposure to excess maternal glucocorticoids ) markedly influence intra-uterine growth and development."
10903125,A picture is also emerging of the biochemical and physiological mechanisms that may underlie these effects.
10903125,This review focuses on recent research directed towards understanding the molecular basis of the relationship between indices of poor early growth and the subsequent development of glucose intolerance and Type 2 diabetes mellitus using animal models that attempt to recreate the process of programming via an adverse intra-uterine or neonatal environment.
10903125,"Emphasis is on the chain of events and potential mechanisms by which adverse adaptations affect pancreatic - beta - cell insulin secretion and the sensitivity to insulin of key metabolic processes , including hepatic glucose production , skeletal - muscle glucose disposal and adipose - tissue lipolysis."
10903125,Unravelling the molecular details involved in metabolic programming may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of impaired glucoregulation and Type 2 diabetes.
15252375,The medical community faces an emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) in children and adolescents with a disproportionate increase among certain ethnic groups.
15252375,T2DM represents one arm of the metabolic syndrome and parallels an increasing prevalence of obesity.
15252375,"The metabolic syndrome includes insulin resistance , hyperlipidemia , and hypertension with a consequent risk of early cardiovascular disease."
15252375,"Thus , treatment of T2DM and the metabolic syndrome pose a challenge for pediatric endocrinologists and represent an enormous public health issue."
15252375,This review presents information about the treatment of childhood T2DM.
15823494,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a polygenic , multifactorial disease."
15823494,Multiple attempts have been made to identify genes that predispose to development of diabetes using both the candidate gene approach and whole genome scanning.
15823494,"However , in spite of substantial financial commitment , very few targets have been identified."
15823494,Identification of predisposing genes is complicated by several factors.
15823494,Diabetic patients demonstrate a variety of gene defect combinations.
15823494,Identification of predisposing genomic regions is thus impeded if data are collected from a heterogeneous population.
15823494,"In addition , the diseased phenotype may only manifest when the net effect of the predisposing factors exceeds a certain "" threshold ""."
15823494,"The effects of predisposing genetic and environmental factors thus appear to be additive , and this also complicates target gene discovery."
15823494,"Using the traditional approach , significant associations between genomic regions and disease are rarely observed unless data are acquired from hundreds of individuals."
15823494,"In contrast , results from whole genome scans performed in homogeneous and consanguineous populations with a high incidence of type 2 diabetes have demonstrated that highly significant associations can be obtained using data from a small number of subjects belonging to the same extended family."
15823494,Such populations offer the promise of substantial progress in type 2 diabetes genomics research.
17559889,"Nutrigenomics promises personalized nutrition and an improvement in preventing , delaying , and reducing the symptoms of chronic diseases such as diabetes."
17559889,Nutritional genomics is the study of how foods affect the expression of genetic information in an individual and how an individual 's genetic makeup affects the metabolism and response to nutrients and other bioactive components in food.
17559889,"The path to those promises has significant challenges , from experimental designs that include analysis of genetic heterogeneity to the complexities of food and environmental factors."
17559889,"One of the more significant complications in developing the knowledge base and potential applications is how to analyze high - dimensional datasets of genetic , nutrient , metabolomic ( clinical ) , and other variables influencing health and disease processes."
17559889,Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is used as an illustration of the challenges in studying complex phenotypes with nutrigenomics concepts and approaches.
24237065,Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) represents a significant global epidemic with more than 285 million people affected worldwide.
24237065,"Regulating glycemia in T2D patients can be partially achieved with currently available treatment , but intensive research during the last decades have led to the discovery of modified compounds or new targets that could represent great hope for safe and effective treatment in the future."
24237065,"Among them , targets in the CNS that are known to control feeding and body weight have been also shown to exert glucoregulatory actions , and could be a key in the development of a new generation of drugs in the field of T2D."
24237065,Such drugs would be of great interest since they can be used both in the treatment of diabetes and obesity.
24237065,"This patent review aims to establish an overview of recent patents disclosing new therapeutic opportunities targeting peripheral , as well as central targets for the treatment of T2D."
31353974,Introduction : The relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is complex and bidirectional.
31353974,NAFLD increases the risk of incident diabetes and is very prevalent in T2DM patients and T2DM is an aggravating factor for NAFLD.
31353974,"Timely T2DM diagnosis and treatment in subjects with NAFLD and diagnosis , staging and treatment of NAFLD in those with T2DM are critical issues."
31353974,Areas covered : PubMed / MEDLINE was searched for articles related to concomitant occurrence of NAFLD and T2DM between January 2013 and May 2019.
31353974,"Areas covered included epidemiological , diagnostic and therapeutic aspects."
31353974,Expert opinion : there is a need for increased awareness on NAFLD adding liver disease as an end - organ complication of T2DM.
31353974,Emphasis on use of simple non-invasive tools to triage patients with potentially severe liver disease should be made.
31353974,Management of patients with NAFLD and T2DM relies on lifestyle optimization to achieve significant weight loss.
31353974,"Currently , there is no drug approved for treatment of NAFLD in patients with T2DM although Vitamin E and pioglitazone might be used in selected patients."
31353974,Approved diabetic medications hold promise for NAFLD treatment and several liver - specific drugs are in evaluation clinical trials.
31353974,A combination approach will likely represent the future of NAFLD therapeutics.
12762953,The emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) in young people reflects increasing rates of obesity and parallels the increasing frequency of T2DM in adults.
12762953,"As in adults , T2DM in children is part of the insulin resistance syndrome that includes hyperandrogenism seen as premature adrenarche and polycystic ovary syndrome , hypertension , dyslipidemia , and other atherosclerosis risk factors."
12762953,"Recent studies in children document risk factors for T2DM , and associated cardiovascular risk factors , including obesity , family history , diabetic gestation , and underweight or overweight for gestational age."
12762953,"Genetically determined insulin resistance or limited beta - cell reserve has been demonstrated in high - risk individuals , including first - degree relatives of girls with premature adrenarche."
12762953,"This genetic background , considered advantageous in a feast - and - famine existence ( the thrifty genotype ) , is rendered detrimental with abundant food and physical inactivity , a lifestyle demonstrated to be typical of families of children with T2DM."
12762953,The increasing incidence of T2DM in children and adolescents threatens to become a major public health problem.
12762953,"Risk factors for cardiovascular disease , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and microalbuminuria are present at diagnosis of T2DM in Native American adolescents , indicating that insulin resistance has been present for some time before the diagnosis of diabetes was made."
12762953,Case finding is likely to be beneficial in high - risk youths.
12762953,Treatment is the same as that of adults.
12762953,The only data on use of oral hypoglycemic agents in children have been with metformin.
12762953,Community and governmental efforts to educate all children and their parents about the need for physical activity and dietary modification are essential to control this epidemic.
20966485,There is an emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) in younger adults.
20966485,"They represent an extreme phenotype : likely to be obese , lead a sedentary lifestyle , have a strong family history of T2DM , be of black or minority ethnic origin , and come from less affluent socioeconomic groups."
20966485,"An accurate diagnosis of T2DM in younger adults , while essential to guide management , can be challenging even for the experienced diabetologist."
20966485,"Comorbidities such as hypertension , nephropathy and hyperlipidaemia are prevalent in this group , and , despite the lack of longitudinal data , they represent a very high risk group , with a need for aggressive management."
20966485,"This focused review of the epidemiology , aetiology , clinical outcomes , comorbidities and management of younger adults with T2DM will provide the non-specialist with up - to - date insight into the UK 's emerging epidemic."
22621171,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) rates are three times higher in patients with bipolar disorder ( BD ) , compared to the general population."
22621171,"This is a major contributing factor to the elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality , the leading cause of death in bipolar patients."
22621171,"There may be shared pathophysiology linking the two disorders , including hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal and mitochondrial dysfunction , common genetic links , and epigenetic interactions."
22621171,"Life - style , phenomenology of bipolar symptoms , and adverse effects of pharmacotherapy may be contributing factors."
22621171,Patients with BD and T2DM have a more severe course of illness and are more refractory to treatment.
22621171,"Control of their diabetes is poorer when compared to diabetics without BD , and an existing disparity in medical care may be partly responsible."
22621171,Glucose abnormalities in bipolar patients need to be screened for and treated.
22621171,"Metformin appears to have the best benefit / risk ratio , and the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitors and glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor agonists and analogues also appear promising , although these agents have not been specifically studied in populations with mood disorders."
22621171,"Physicians need to be aware of the increased risk for T2DM and cardiovascular disease in bipolar patients , and appropriate prevention , screening , case finding , and treatment is recommended."
23953075,"The growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide , mainly due to the micro - and macrovascular complications associated with the disease."
23953075,A growing body of evidence suggests that although the risk of developing complications is greater with glucose levels beyond the established threshold for diagnosis -- increasing in parallel with rising hyperglycemia - individuals with glucose levels in the prediabetic range are already at increased risk.
23953075,"Early intervention , ideally as soon as abnormalities in glucose homeostasis are detected , is of great importance to minimize the burden of the disease."
23953075,"However , as the early stages of the disease are asymptomatic , diagnosing prediabetes and early overt type 2 diabetes is challenging."
23953075,"The aim of this article is to discuss these challenges , the benefits of early intervention -- with emphasis on the prevention trials showing that progression to type 2 diabetes can be delayed by addressing prediabetes -- and the existing evidence - based guidelines that have been drawn to optimize the standards of care at the prediabetes and overt type 2 diabetes stages."
Richard Aguilar ,"The growing epidemic of T2DM requires intervention to assist patients who have been diagnosed to better manage the disease , to reduce the risk of developing the disease in those who have not yet been diagnosed , and to manage the associated complications."
Richard Aguilar ,"In addition to individualizing interventions based on a patient 's needs , concerns , and capabilities , taking gender into account is necessary."
Richard Aguilar ,"In otherwise healthy people , several independent factors appear to pose a higher risk of T2DM in men relative to women , including systolic hypertension , regular smoking , and alcohol intake ≥ 40 g / d."
Richard Aguilar ,"At the same time , men achieve greater risk reduction from moderate daily alcohol intake and a diet high in fish and seafood , low - fat dairy products , whole grains , and magnesium."
Richard Aguilar ,"Once diagnosed with T2DM , men generally fare better than women regarding the risk for CVD ; they also have a better prognosis after MI and a lower risk of death overall from CVD."
Richard Aguilar ,"Possible independent risk factors for CVD in men with T2DM that are especially important may include hypertension , poor glycemic control , and low HDL - C levels."
Richard Aguilar ,"Psychosocial complications , such as depression , are less likely in men with T2DM."
Richard Aguilar ,"However , men expend less effort coping , are less likely to utilize healthcare services , and are less informed about treatment options."
Richard Aguilar ,"Although men have a lower expectation of the benefit of self - management , they find support from family and friends more helpful than do women , but they are fearful of losing control of their disease."
Richard Aguilar ,Taking these gender differences into account should prove helpful as family care physicians work with men to reduce their risk of developing T2DM and in helping men diagnosed with T2DM to better self - manage their disease.
25708055,"Carotid intima - media thickness has been widely used as a surrogate end - point for cardiovascular disease , myocardial infarction , and stroke."
25708055,This study aimed to assess the effects of active and passive smoking exposure on the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
25708055,Seven hundred twenty - two patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited for the study.
25708055,"A standardized questionnaire on smoking status , pack - years of smoking , and the number of years of smoking cessation was provided to the patients , and their responses were collected for analysis."
25708055,"The carotid intima - media thickness , carotid plaque , and the internal diameter of the common carotid artery were determined by high - resolution B - mode ultrasonography."
25708055,"Compared to non-smokers , passive female smokers had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease ( odds ratio = 3.50 , 95 % confidence interval : 1.29 - 9.49 , P = 0.009 ) ; they also had a significantly larger common carotid artery ( P = 0.041 ) and risk of carotid plaque ( odds ratio = 2.20 , 95 % confidence interval : 1.1980 - 4.0505 , P = 0.01 )."
25708055,"Both active and passive male smokers had a significantly greater carotid intima - media thickness than non-smokers ( P = 0.003 and P = 0.005 , respectively )."
25708055,"Male active smokers had a significantly higher risk of carotid plaque ( odds ratio = 2.88 , 95 % confidence interval : 1.4788 - 5.6094 , P = 0.001 )."
25708055,"In conclusion , cumulative active and passive smoking exposures are significant risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
25708055,Our results highlight the importance of endorsing a smoke - free environment for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
15291771,Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a familial disorder that is fast becoming epidemic in the USA.
15291771,It is possible that nurses will care for entire families with diabetes in the near future.
15291771,"In multiple studies , family functioning , a family systems variable , has been correlated with self - management and glycemic outcomes."
15291771,Most persons with diabetes live with family members who might facilitate or inhibit self - management tasks or skills.
15291771,Multiple afflictions of family members with diabetes can further complicate matters relating to diabetes self - management.
15291771,"Diabetes collectively affects over 16 million people in the USA , incurring healthcare costs in excess of 92 billion dollars annually."
15291771,Individuals engage in self - management behavior for diabetes care in the context of their family 's environment.
15291771,It is imperative that nurses consider factors that might inhibit or facilitate self - management efforts by individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
15291771,"Assessment of family determinants of adaptation to diabetes with appropriate interventions can improve clinical outcomes , subsequently preventing complications."
17331067,Few Type 2 diabetes loci are considered confirmed and replicated across multiple populations.
17331067,"Some genes that have become accepted as contributors to diabetes risk include : calpain 10 , peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma , ATP - sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6 .2 , hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha and hepatic transcription factor 1."
17331067,"While numerous reports of new diabetes loci enter the literature on a regular basis , this review focuses on selected novel associations reported within the last 12 months."
17331067,"In particular , we highlight recent reports of associations between Type 2 diabetes and the transcription factor 7 - like 2 gene , associations with micro-opioid receptor and supressor of cytokine signaling 2 genes , and expression and functional analyses of adipokines vaspin and retinol binding protein 4."
17331067,These new results provide insights into possible mechanisms influencing disease susceptibility and thus new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for Type 2 diabetes.
14555298,"Introduction / aims : The goal of the trial was the assessment of the quality of diabetes control and the cognitive function of all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated in a randomly selected general practitioner practice in Thuringia , Germany."
14555298,Furthermore possible interactions between patients ' quality of diabetes control and their cognitive function should be analysed.
14555298,"Patients and methods : The investigation comprised all 141 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( age 67.3 + / - 10.5 years , body - mass index 29.3 + / - 4.5 kg / m2 , patients without insulin therapy : n = 102 , with insulin therapy : n = 39 ) who were patients at the general practitioner practice in Wandersleben , Thuringia , Germany , between November 1999 and April 2000."
14555298,Results : The mean HbA1c of all patients examined was 6.33 + / - 1.1 % ( normal range 3.5 - 6.8 % ).
14555298,55 patients were treated with diet ( HbA1c 5.7 + / - 0.76 % ) and 47 patients were given oral antidiabetic drugs ( HbA1c 6.5 + / - 0.76 % ).
14555298,"27/47 ( 57.4 % ) patients were treated with sulfonylurea , 37/47 ( 78,7 % ) with metformin , 3/47 ( 6,4 % ) with acarbose and 7/47 ( 14.9 % ) patients received glinides."
14555298,"18/47 ( 38,3 % ) patients had combinations out of two or more oral antidiabetic drugs."
14555298,A total of 39 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with insulin ( HbA1c 7.0 + / - 1.24 % ).
14555298,The premorbide cognitive function of the patients was 97.9 + / - 10.0 IQ - points.
14555298,"It was significantly better than the actual cognitive function ( 91.8 + / - 13.5 IQ - points , p < 0.001 )."
14555298,"The actual cognitive function showed a correlation with patient 's age ( r = -0.28 , p = 0.001 ) , educational level ( r = -0.25 , p = 0.006 ) and profession ( r = -0.29 , p = 0.001 )."
14555298,"Performing multivariate analysis the premorbide cognitive function ( b = 0.53 , p < 0.001 ) and patient 's age ( b = -0.32 , p < 0.001 ) showed associations with the actual cognitive function ( R - square = 0.36 )."
14555298,"Associations with the HbA1c ( R - square = 0.37 ) showed the frequency of blood glucose self monitoring ( beta = 0.38 , p < 0.001 ) , the blood glucose value at the time of examination ( beta = 0.34 , p < 0.001 ) and the diabetes duration ( beta = 0.16 , p = 0.03 )."
14555298,There were no associations between actual cognitive function and other parameters.
14555298,Conclusions : The data from this trial presents evidence which shows that treatment by general practitioners can enable patients both with and without insulin therapy to achieve a high quality of diabetes control.
14555298,"Hence , the results derived from ambulatory evaluations of treatment programmes can not be automatically tansferred to patients treated at hospitals."
14555298,"Regarding inpatient treatment , adapted structured treatment and teaching programmes are mandatory."
16329529,"At the same time they are reporting the current obesity epidemic , U.S. physicians are also seeing a dramatic increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adolescent patients."
16329529,"In this article , Drs Laurencin , Goldschmidt , and Fisher summarize the prevalence and risk factors , clinical presentation , diagnosis , and treatment of type 2 diabetes in adolescents."
16329529,They also offer interventional strategies for both lifestyle change and pharmacologic management.
21091713,The world is facing an unprecedented increase in type 2 diabetes.
21091713,Most disability and premature mortality experienced by people with diabetes is related to cardiovascular disease.
21091713,This review summarizes recent evidence about approaches for managing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes.
21091713,"While optimal blood pressure targets in people with diabetes remain uncertain , new data have demonstrated the benefits of routine blood pressure lowering in these patients , when administered without regard to initial blood pressure level."
21091713,Other recent data indicate that blood pressure lowering treatment in patients with diabetes needs to be continued for ongoing benefit.
21091713,"The effects of intensive blood glucose lowering have been evaluated recently in a number of large trials , and individually these have failed to provide evidence of cardioprotection over a 4 - 5 year period."
21091713,"However , longer - term follow - up data suggest that there may be a delay in any such benefits becoming apparent."
21091713,"The benefits of statin therapy in preventing cardiovascular events in diabetic patients have been recently confirmed in a systematic overview of relevant trials ; however , effects of fibrate therapy appear more limited."
21091713,"The role of antiplatelet agents remains unknown , as adequately powered trials of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes have not yet been completed."
30520772,The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes management in the Caribbean region.
19276801,"Purpose of review : To examine the value of early detection of type 2 diabetes from the perspective of potential benefits and harms to the individual , and from the perspective of the health system."
19276801,"Recent findings : Early detection of type 2 diabetes can be justified because diabetes is an important health problem , has a relatively long asymptomatic phase , interventions are available that have a proven beneficial effect on clinically meaningful outcomes and screening procedures are safe , acceptable and have adequate sensitivity and specificity."
19276801,"However , it remains controversial because of a lack of an established evidence base that detection earlier in the natural history of diabetes is indeed beneficial to individuals."
19276801,"Summary : Although there are many reasons why the earlier detection of diabetes could be beneficial , the magnitude of any potential benefit of early detection and treatment has yet to be quantitated in a randomized controlled trial and this information will be available in 2010 when the Anglo - Danish - Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment and Complication reports its findings."
17522982,Epidemiological studies have linked low birth weight with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in later life.
17522982,"This finding has been observed in many populations worldwide , in many different ethnic and socio - economic groups."
17522982,These studies led to the proposal of the ' thrifty phenotype hypothesis ' that suggests that the foetal environment plays a major role in mediating this relationship.
17522982,Here we review the human studies and those in animal models which support the ' thrifty phenotype hypothesis '.
17522982,"Molecular pathways underlying the mechanisms by which a suboptimal foetal environment leads to increased risk of type 2 diabetes are discussed , along with future directions outlining how these pathways and programming events can be further dissected to discover plausible intervention strategies to reduce type 2 diabetes."
20958092,Context : Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is a major public health concern and has reached epidemic proportions in the Canadian First Nation population.
20958092,"Reasons for this epidemic are the consequences of low socioeconomic status , and challenges to screening , primary prevention , management and access to care."
20958092,Issue : This article presents the authors ' opinions of the healthcare needs specific to the First Nation population in Canada with respect to management of T2D.
20958092,Lessons learned : The authors argue that the current Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines are insufficient to provide a basis for health care and funding policies related to T2D management in the First Nation population.
20958092,The authors present their own recommendations in relation to funding policies and the appropriateness of services for the First Nation population.
17700350,"Purpose : The purpose of this review is to present the clinical issues , including risk , etiology , screening and identification , complications , management , and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) in children and to discuss the role of the pediatric physical therapist in effectively managing children with T2DM."
17700350,"Summary of key points : In studies done worldwide , T2DM is being diagnosed in children at rates much greater than that of type 1 diabetes."
17700350,"Sedentary lifestyle and the high prevalence of obesity are the primary problems , setting the stage for a lifetime of health complications for many of today 's youth."
17700350,Recommendations : Health care providers must understand this disease to ensure proper management.
17700350,A multidisciplinary approach is advocated for those children who are at risk for and diagnosed with T2DM to help prevent the disabling and often incapacitating complications associated with T2DM.
30131299,"Aims : Online patient education is a growing form of support to patients with chronic conditions , including type 2 diabetes ( Type 2 DM ) and cardiovascular disease ( CVD )."
30131299,Multiple systematic reviews have been undertaken on this topic with conflicting results.
30131299,We aim to explore the applications of online patient education in Type 2 DM and CVD and synthesise current evidence.
30131299,Methods : A systematic review of systematic reviews was performed.
30131299,"Ovid Medline , EMBASE and Cochrane Database were searched between January 2005 and May 2018."
30131299,Systematic reviews considering patient outcomes of online education interventions for adults with Type 2 DM and / or CVD were included.
30131299,"Quality assessment and data extraction was carried out in duplicate , and data combined using narrative synthesis."
30131299,The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42016034018.
30131299,"Results : Twenty - three systematic reviews were eligible , synthesizing evidence from 87 distinct primary studies."
30131299,"Six reviews were high quality , nine used meta - analysis."
30131299,"Biological , behavioural , psychological , knowledge and self - efficacy measures are all potential targets."
30131299,The outcomes most consistently showing benefits were knowledge and social support.
30131299,Conclusions : Online patient education has wide ranging benefits for people with Type 2 DM or CVD.
30131299,Strengths of this review include its comprehensive synthesis of the large amount of literature on this topic.
17846976,Aims : The FINDRISC questionnaire is a screening tool to estimate the risks for type 2 diabetes as well as asymptomatic type 2 diabetes.
17846976,We aimed to evaluate its performance to predict diabetes in a German population and to compare its predictive and detective ability in the same population.
17846976,Methods : A total of 552 subjects with increased risk of type 2 diabetes were investigated.
17846976,All individuals completed the FINDRISC questionnaires and underwent an oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ).
17846976,All individuals were followed for 3 years and underwent an OGTT again.
17846976,The performance of the opportunistic screening was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve ( AUC ).
17846976,An intervention program was carried out for all diabetic and IFG / IGT patients at baseline.
17846976,"Results : For identification , the asymptomatic type 2 DM was named Condition 1 ; prediction of type 2 DM risk in the follow - up survey as Condition 2 ; and diabetes risk predicting in a hypothetical case of survey without intervention program as Condition 3."
17846976,"The ROC - AUC in the three condition were AUC ( FINDRISC1 ) = 0.745 , AUC ( FINDRISC2 ) = 0.789 , and AUC ( FINDRISC3 ) = 0.775 , respectively."
17846976,"A significant association between FINDRISC and evolution of disease was found , but the variation of plasma glucose during the three years follow - up was not associated with FINDRISC."
17846976,People in the intervention group with an improvement of glucose tolerance had a smaller FINDRISC score than persons with an unchanged or progressive condition of disease.
17846976,Conclusion : FINDRISC was validated in our study as a simple tool with high performance to predict diabetes risk and less efficient to identify asymptomatic type 2 diabetes.
17846976,People with lower FINDRISC score will benefit easier from preventive intervention.
19962030,Youth - onset type 2 diabetes is a serious public health problem for Indigenous people throughout the world.
19962030,"This article reviews the epidemiology , disease burden , treatment , and challenges in achieving successful clinical management of this disorder in Indigenous youth."
19962030,Screening criteria and the complications and comorbidities of type 2 diabetes are also reviewed.
22762229,"The burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) among Indigenous children and adolescents is much greater than in non-Indigenous young people and appears to be rising , although data on epidemiology and complications are limited."
22762229,Young Indigenous people living in remote areas appear to be at excess risk of T2DM.
22762229,"Most young Indigenous people with T2DM are asymptomatic at diagnosis and typically have a family history of T2DM , are overweight or obese and may have signs of hyperinsulinism such as acanthosis nigricans."
22762229,Onset is usually during early adolescence.
22762229,"Barriers to addressing T2DM in young Indigenous people living in rural and remote settings relate to health service access , demographics , socioeconomic factors , cultural factors , and limited resources at individual and health service levels."
22762229,"We recommend screening for T2DM for any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person aged > 10 years ( or past the onset of puberty ) who is overweight or obese , has a positive family history of diabetes , has signs of insulin resistance , has dyslipidaemia , has received psychotropic therapy , or has been exposed to diabetes in utero."
22762229,"Individualised management plans should include identification of risk factors , complications , behavioural factors and treatment targets , and should take into account psychosocial factors which may influence health care interaction , treatment success and clinical outcomes."
22762229,"Preventive strategies , including lifestyle modification , need to play a dominant role in tackling T2DM in young Indigenous people."
25270482,Increased prevalence of diabetes in the community has been accompanied by an increase in diabetes in hospitalised patients.
25270482,"About a quarter of these patients experience a hypoglycaemic episode during their admission , which is associated with increased risk of mortality and length of stay."
25270482,"This article examines the aetiology , pathophysiology , diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes using a case study approach."
25270482,The psychosocial implications for the patient are also discussed.
25270482,The case study is based on a patient with diabetes who was admitted to hospital following a hypoglycaemic episode and cared for during a practice placement.
25270482,The importance of early diagnosis of diabetes and the adverse effects of delayed diagnosis are discussed.
32296212,"Objective : To determine the knowledge , attitudes and practices of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients."
32296212,"Methods : The cross-sectonal study was conducted at Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Hospital , Rawalakot , Azad Kashmir , from March 26 to September 25 , 2017 , and comprised patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus who were enrolled using convenience sampling."
32296212,Each participant completed a self - administered 35 - item questionnaire.
32296212,Data was analysed using SPSS 23 to determine the correlations among variables.
32296212,"Results : Of the 116 patients , 74 ( 63.8 % ) were females , and the largest group 58 ( 50 % ) was aged 51 - 70 years."
32296212,"Of the total , 111 ( 95.6 % ) had heard about type 2 diabetes mellitus , 112 ( 96.6 % ) had sought treatment after diagnosis , and 115 ( 99.1 % ) had blood sugar tested within the preceding year."
32296212,"There was a positive correlation between knowledge and attitude ( p = 0.005 ) , knowledge and practice ( p < 0.001 ) , and attitude and practice ( p < 0.001 )."
32296212,"Knowledge , attitude and practice improved with increase in education ( p > 0.05 )."
32296212,"Conclusions : The subjects had fair knowledge and good attitude toward type 2 diabetes mellitus , and they appeared willing to improve diabetic control."
32296212,"However , diabetes - related practice was found to be poor."
24070886,"Objective : With the aim of optimizing diabetes education , type 2 diabetes awareness , primary prevention and secondary prevention , we studied how African Canadians experience type 2 diabetes."
24070886,"Specifically , we studied stories told by African Canadians living in Calgary , Alberta , Canada , about significant events and experiences at the time of their diagnosis with type 2 diabetes."
24070886,"Methods : From recorded interviews , we extracted themes from stories about diagnosis , using hermeneutic phenomenology."
24070886,Participants included 11 African Canadians older than age 18 and at least 1 - year post-diagnosis.
24070886,Transcribed stories were analyzed for units of meaning describing significant themes / experiences about the diagnosis.
24070886,"Extracted units of meaning were organized into themes that were presented to a focus group of African Canadians in Calgary to garner their perspective on the findings , discuss the implications and make recommendations for improvements."
24070886,"Results : All participants reported experiencing shock , disbelief , fear and a sense of helplessness immediately after their diagnosis."
24070886,These rendered them unable to think clearly or start their treatment regimen until propelled by additional forces.
24070886,"Also , 73 % of participants reported experiencing anger / denial about the diagnosis for some time , whereas 18 % reported a short - lived relief that they could finally put a name to their symptoms."
24070886,"However , the overarching issue associated with all of the themes appeared to emanate from a lack of type 2 diabetes awareness."
24070886,Conclusions : Emotions experienced by participants seemed precipitated by a lack of type 2 diabetes awareness.
24070886,"Some community - specific factors contributed to the lack of type 2 diabetes awareness , which appeared to impede primary and secondary prevention among participants."
24070886,Recommendations for ameliorating these factors are presented.
15561920,The macro - and microvascular burden of type 2 diabetes is well established.
15561920,"A number of recent single risk factor intervention trials targeting hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia , hypertension , procoagulation , microalbumuria , and existing cardiovascular disorders have , however , shown major beneficial effects on long - term outcome."
15561920,"The results from these studies are anticipated to change the future management of type 2 diabetes , and most of the updated national guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes recommend a multipronged approach driven by ambitious treatment targets."
15561920,"The outcome of this intensive integrated therapy has , however , only been investigated in a few studies of patients with type 2 diabetes."
15561920,"One of these trials , the Steno - 2 Study , showed that intensive intervention for an average of 7.8 years cuts cardiovascular events as well as nephropathy , retinopathy , and autonomic neuropathy by about half when compared with a conventional multifactorial treatment."
15561920,The challenge for now is to ensure that the trial experiences are widely adopted in daily clinical practice.
22897868,"Recent advances in understanding the etiology of obesity , metabolic syndrome , and type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) have established involvement of the immune system."
22897868,These developments highlight the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for treatment of these conditions.
22897868,"Here , we discuss current and new immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of T2D , the need for stratification of patients based on immune and autoimmune status , and biomarkers for evaluating treatment efficiency."
22897868,"The time has come to re-evaluate the clinical management of T2D patients using metabolic parameters alone , and to realize that patients should be stratified based on their immune and / or autoimmune status prior to initiation of therapy to realize fully the potential of immunomodulatory strategies for T2D."
26351268,Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is a progressive chronic disease that requires significant self - surveillance and adherence to the treatment protocols for successful management and future health.
26351268,There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that diabetes education is beneficial for patient outcomes.
26351268,"However , there is some debate about how best to deliver diabetes education , whether individually or in groups."
26351268,"Although several studies have investigated the role of group education in improving the management of T2DM , few studies have examined this issue from the client 's perspective."
26351268,It is here that this study makes a contribution to understanding diabetes management.
26351268,"Drawing on systematic observation of group education sessions provided by diabetic resource nurses and in - depth interviews with clients , this paper describes the experiences , perspectives and significance of these sessions to clients."
26351268,"Our results suggest that group education sessions were seen as valuable to the clients for : the opportunity they provided to meet others living with diabetes ; to improve motivation for managing the disease ; and to enhance knowledge of diabetes , its management and long - term implications."
26351268,"In short , this study demonstrates that the clients value group education sessions for the social contact , increasing knowledge about the disease for self - management and support they provide ; factors recognised as important to maintaining health."
26351268,"In addition , group education sessions appear to be a cost - effective method for diabetes self - management that funders need to consider."
28914196,Background : Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) is turning out to be a global health crisis.
28914196,Currently available literature clearly indicates an increased risk of type 2 diabetes amongst South Asian population.
28914196,"Objective : The objective of this narrative review is to explore the non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors of T2DM in South Asian population , including their beliefs , attitudes , socio economic and cultural barriers and also to explore the possible implications in designing culture specific diabetes prevention and management programs."
28914196,Methods : This narrative review is based upon the data from individual studies and review article known to the authors.
28914196,Additional relevant studies were identified through PubMed search on Englishlanguage papers published in 2000 - 2017 using the relevant keywords.
28914196,"Where appropriate , the reference lists of key papers were reviewed to identify additional studies of interest."
28914196,"Results : Many genetic and environmental risk factors such as diet , physical inactivity , and sleep contribute to the increased prevalence of diabetes in the ethnic group."
28914196,Providing mere knowledge about diabetes and these risk factors might not be sufficient in this particular ethnic group.
28914196,"It is essential to address their beliefs , attitudes and the cultural barriers faced."
28914196,"Conclusion : To overcome the health disparity in the South Asian ethnic group , various risk factors associated with diabetes , and the challenges faced are to be considered while designing future diabetes prevention and management strategies."
27376421,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and the cardiovascular effect of antidiabetic drugs are today critical medical issues , with the prevalence of T2DM in particular showing a steep increase worldwide , mainly due to unhealthy lifestyle habits."
27376421,"T2DM in association with obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors , results in the development of CVD , the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with T2DM."
27376421,"Thus , treatment of T2DM is an individualized and complex challenge in which targeting cardiovascular risk factors is an important component in the decision making."
27376421,"Given the cardiovascular adverse events associated with rosiglitazone , both the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency currently require the demonstration of cardiovascular safety of new antidiabetic drugs."
27376421,"Consequently , clinical trials to guarantee their cardiovascular safety are now obligatory."
27376421,This review aims to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular effects and safety of the major drugs used in T2DM treatment and also to provide an overview of upcoming and ongoing clinical trials in this field.
27376421,"Our belief is that this review will be of substantial assistance to all medical doctors who are treating diabetic patients , namely primary care physicians , internal medicine doctors , endocrinologists , diabetologists and less well experienced personnel such as young doctors in training."
25187508,Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ).
25187508,"Cardiometabolic risk factors , including hyperglycaemia , insulin resistance , atherogenic dyslipidaemia , increased visceral fat and inflammation , are associated with increased risk in this population and represent potential targets for treatment."
25187508,"In this review , management strategies for patients with T2DM post-ACS , both in the acute - care setting and in the long - term , are discussed."
25187508,"Although the benefits of long - term , aggressive , multifactorial risk factor modification are well established , a significant burden of recurrent events remains and the search for novel strategies continues."
25187508,Several studies are assessing the potential cardiovascular ( CV ) benefits and safety of various classes of newer agents.
25187508,"Of these , AleCardio ( aleglitazar ) , Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes With Alogliptin versus Standard of Care in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Acute Coronary Syndrome ( EXAMINE ; alogliptin ) and Evaluation of LIXisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ELIXA ; lixisenatide ) specifically address patients with type 2 diabetes post-ACS."
25187508,The mechanisms of action of these new therapies and aims of the CV outcome studies are briefly reviewed.
25187508,The prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide highlighting the need for new strategies that address the complex underlying processes that drive atherosclerosis and CV events in this high - risk patient population.
19893798,Background : In recent years there has been a worldwide increase in the number of diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) in children and adolescents.
19893798,This has become a major focus for the work of the International Diabetes Federation.
19893798,"In Australia , most children and adolescents with diabetes have type 1 diabetes."
19893798,"However , more young Australians are developing T2DM."
19893798,"Objective : This article presents the case of a girl , Aroha , 13 years of age and of Polynesian descent , who presents with high random blood glucose levels."
19893798,"It outlines the diagnosis , treatment and prognosis of T2DM in children and adolescents."
19893798,Discussion : Type 2 diabetes is the consequence of a complex interaction between genes and the environment in a susceptible individual.
19893798,"Children with T2DM are generally overweight , often with central adiposity."
19893798,Having one or more parents with T2DM gives offspring up to an 80 % chance of developing T2DM.
19893798,At risk children and adolescents should be screened for T2DM.
19893798,It is important to check the glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) antibody to exclude type 1 diabetes.
19893798,Symptoms and signs of the metabolic syndrome should be sought.
19893798,Child and adolescent patients with T2DM face the psychological burden of living a lifetime with a chronic disease.
19893798,"Management is team based and team members include the general practitioner , diabetes educator , dietician and endocrinologist."
19893798,"Goals include achieving and maintaining normoglycaemia , weight reduction and increased physical activity."
19893798,Lifestyle modification alone may control minor hyperglycaemia and metformin can be added to control moderate hyperglycaemia.
19893798,"In severe hypoglycaemia , insulin may be required initially to achieve normoglycaemia and can be phased out and metformin phased in later."
19893798,Insulin is likely to be required again later in the natural history of disease.
19893798,Little is known about factors affecting complication risk in children and adolescents with T2DM but they essentially have a ' double whammy ' of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome and are likely to develop macrovascular complications much earlier than adults who develop T2DM.
21829607,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a growing , worldwide public health concern."
21829607,"Recent growth has been particularly dramatic in the states of The Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf ( GCC ) , and these and other developing economies are at particular risk."
21829607,"We aimed to systematically review the quality of control of type 2 diabetes in the GCC , and the nature and efficacy of interventions."
21829607,We identified 27 published studies for review.
21829607,Studies were identified by systematic database searches.
21829607,"Medline and Embase were searched separately ( via Dialog and Ovid , respectively ; 1950 to July 2010 ( Medline ) , and 1947 to July 2010 ( Embase ) ) on 15/07/2009."
21829607,The search was updated on 08/07/2010.
21829607,"Terms such as diabetes mellitus , non-insulin-dependent , hyperglycemia , hypertension , hyperlipidemia and Gulf States were used."
21829607,"Our search also included scanning reference lists , contacting experts and hand - searching key journals."
21829607,"Studies were judged against pre-determined inclusion / exclusion criteria , and where suitable for inclusion , data extraction / quality assessment was achieved using a specifically - designed tool."
21829607,"All studies wherein glycaemic - , blood pressure - and / or lipid - control were investigated ( clinical and / or process outcomes ) were eligible for inclusion."
21829607,"No limitations on publication type , publication status , study design or language of publication were imposed."
21829607,We found the extent of control to be sub-optimal and relatively poor.
21829607,"Assessment of the efficacy of interventions was difficult due to lack of data , but suggestive that more widespread and controlled trial of secondary prevention strategies may have beneficial outcomes."
21829607,We found no record of audited implementation of primary preventative strategies and anticipate that controlled trial of such strategies would also be useful.
22893407,Nonhuman primates provide the ideal animal model for discovering and examining further the mechanisms underlying human type 2 diabetes mellitus.
22893407,In all aspects studied to date the nonhuman primate has been shown to develop the same disease with the same features that develop in overweight middle - aged humans.
22893407,"This includes the progressive development of the known complications of diabetes , all of which are extraordinarily like those identified in humans."
22893407,"In addition , for the development and evaluation of new therapeutic agents , the translation of findings from nonhuman primates to application in humans has been highly predictable."
22893407,"Both therapeutic efficacy and identification of potential adverse responses can be effectively examined in nonhuman primates due to their great similarity to humans at the molecular , biochemical , and physiological levels."
22893407,This chapter provides guidance for the development and management of a colony of monkeys with naturally occurring type 2 diabetes mellitus.
20173359,"Typical civilization diseases , such as type 2 diabetes , share several features : their worldwide frequency , the complexity of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms , heterogeneity in the phenotypes and their multifactorial nature due to a wide variety of possible combinations of disease susceptibility or protective genes in different tissues and negative or positive environmental factors."
20173359,"This is in sharp contrast to classical inherited diseases , such as Huntington 's chorea , which are often caused by complete loss - or gain - of - function mutations in a single gene."
20173359,"The causative polymorphisms of susceptibility genes , however , are characterized by relatively subtle alterations in the function of the corresponding gene products , i.e. low penetrance and effect size , which do not support the pathogenesis per se , and by their high frequency ; these two characteristics result in high expenditures for their identification and a rather low predictive value."
20173359,"In the future , the reliable and early diagnosis of common diseases will thus depend on the determination of all ( or as many as possible ) polymorphisms of each susceptibility gene together with the corresponding gene products and the metabolites emerging thereof for each individual."
20173359,Great hopes are currently associated with systems biology to cover these demands in time ( i.e. along the pathogenesis ) and space ( i.e. in all relevant tissues ).
11430184,"Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent form of diabetes , accounting for approximately 90 % of cases."
11430184,"This article examines the current classification , diagnostic criteria for diabetes , and screening recommendations and provides a therapeutic strategy for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes."
18519930,Description : Updated U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) recommendation about screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults.
18519930,"Methods : To estimate the balance of benefits and harms of screening , the USPSTF updated its 2003 evidence review , adding evidence from new trials as well as updates on earlier studies."
18519930,"The review for this current recommendation focused on evidence that early treatment prevented long - term adverse outcomes of diabetes , including cardiovascular events , visual impairment , renal failure , and amputation."
18519930,Recommendations : Screen for type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic adults with sustained blood pressure ( either treated or untreated ) greater than 135/80 mm Hg.
18519930,( B recommendation ) Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening in asymptomatic adults with blood pressure of 135/80 mm Hg or lower.
18519930,( I statement ).
12537092,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , characterized by insulin resistance and a beta - cell secretory defect , appears to result from a number of gene and environmental interactions."
12537092,There are marked differences in the phenotypic expression of type 2 DM with individuals exhibiting varying levels of insulin resistance and impairments in insulin secretion.
12537092,"Study results indicate that a number of healthy lifestyle behaviors , such as increased physical activity and reduced intake of dietary fat , are associated with decreased development of type 2 DM."
12537092,This article explores the genetic and environmental factors associated with the development of type 2 DM along with the role of lifestyle modifications in the prevention of this disease.
16573308,"Although diabetes is now a worldwide epidemic , the rate of increase in its prevalence in developing countries is alarming."
16573308,"By the year 2025 , more than three - quarters of all persons with diabetes will reside in developing countries."
16573308,"India and China are leading this surge in diabetes , and sub-Saharan Africa is currently at a lower prevalence rate."
16573308,"However , the estimated increase is substantial among African descendants in the Americas , West Indies and throughout the diaspora."
16573308,There are compelling reasons why aggressive efforts must be directed toward primary prevention of diabetes in developing countries.
16573308,"Once diabetes develops , the cost of caring for patients is prohibitive."
16573308,"Poorly managed diabetes leads to several complications ( e.g. , end - stage renal failure , blindness , amputation and heart disease ) that many developing countries are ill equipped to tackle."
16573308,"In landmark trials , lifestyle modification approaches are more efficacious than expensive medications in the prevention of diabetes."
16573308,"This is fortunate because lifestyle modification can be implemented locally , whereas medications often need to be imported at high cost."
16573308,The first task is the education of policymakers on the urgent need for timely action to prevent the looming epidemic of diabetes.
16573308,"Once governments become convinced of its critical value , the translation of diabetes prevention through dietary modification and increased physical activity would require careful planning , extensive piloting and creativity in the allocation of scant resources."
16573308,"External support , foreign aid , debt forgiveness and other forms of creative financing will almost certainly be needed to implement widespread diabetes prevention programs in developing countries."
25772641,"The concept of lower is better when considering the goal for glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus has recently been challenged due to recent studies , such as ACCORD , ADVANCE , and VADT , which have observed increased morbidity and mortality from intensive control , especially in older adults , and in those with long duration of diabetes disease and chronic complications."
25772641,"Although evidence in younger patients suggest that blood glucose levels should not be above 180 mg / dl ( 10.0 mmol / l ) , there are many unanswered questions and controversies regarding the benefits and risks , methods to achieve and maintain these levels while avoiding hypoglycemia ( < 70 mg % ( 3.9 mmol / l ) ) in the older population."
25772641,"Since the population is aging with a greater life expectancy , it is crucial that these questions be answered."
25772641,"Although several studies of inpatient non-ICU diabetes management have been published , few include older patients."
25772641,This review will examine available recommendations and explore those controversies regarding non-ICU hospital management in this vulnerable patient population.
25772641,Additional conditions that impact upon achieving glycemic control will also be discussed.
25772641,"Finally , the older individual has many special needs which may be more important to consider than in young or middle - aged individuals , when transitioning care from in - hospital to home in a patient - centered approach , as recommended by the American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) and European Society for the Study of Diabetes ( EASD )."
16988549,Clinical and epidemiologic observations have led to the concept of a procoagulant state in type 2 diabetes.
16988549,"This study aimed to determine the coagulation status in type 2 diabetic patients using rotation thromboelastography ( ROTEM ) , which measures the interactive dynamic coagulation process."
16988549,"For this purpose , 51 ( 30 women , 21 men ) type 2 diabetic patients ( mean age , 56.1 years ) and 40 age - matched , sex - matched and body - mass - index - matched healthy individuals were enrolled."
16988549,Twenty - seven of the diabetic group had diabetic vascular complications.
16988549,"ROTEM using different activators for the intrinsic and extrinsic systems of coagulation cascade ( intrinsic TEM - INTEM , extrinsic TEM - EXTEM , FIBTEM ) was used to measure the coagulation time ( CT ) , clot formation time ( CFT ) , alpha angle ( alpha ) and maximum clot firmness ( MCF )."
16988549,"No significant difference was found in the prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , thrombin time , fibrinogen and platelet count between the two groups."
16988549,"INTEM - CT and INTEM - CFT and EXTEM - MCF were significantly higher in the diabetic group compared with controls ( P = 0.012 , P = 0.007 and P = 0.029 , respectively )."
16988549,INTEM alpha in the diabetic group was significantly lower than the controls ( P = 0.001 ).
16988549,"All other parameters , including INTEM - MCF , EXTEM - CT , EXTEM - CFT , EXTEM - alpha , FIBTEM - CT , FIBTEM - CFT , FIBTEM - MCF and FIBTEM - alpha , were similar between the two groups."
16988549,"Taking into account these data , we conclude that there is subtle activation of the extrinsic pathway with a concomitant decrement in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade in type 2 diabetes."
16988549,"The exact underlying mechanisms leading to these changes , and their consequences with regard to diabetic complications , remain to be determined."
1485947,"Type 2 diabetes is a familial disease , but recent analysis of nuclear families indicates it is unlikely to be due to a single dominant gene with high penetrance and that it could be polygenic."
1485947,"Insulin resistance is a major feature , with obesity being a major determinant."
1485947,Beta cell deficiency is a sine qua non of Type 2 diabetes.
1485947,"It is possible that obesity , insulin resistance independent from obesity and impaired beta cell function are independently inherited factors."
1485947,None of these can be said to be ' primary ' as diabetes usually results from the interaction of several geometric and environmental factors.
1485947,"This makes linkage analysis of Type 2 diabetes of uncertain benefit , since heterogeneity can occur within a pedigree."
1485947,"The only mutation so far discovered is of glucokinase producing maturity - onset diabetes of the young , that has a clearly defined and unusual phenotype."
1485947,"Identification of genes that cause classical Type 2 diabetes is likely to come from population association studies , molecular scanning techniques and direct sequencing of candidate genes rather than linkage analysis."
29227582,"Diabetes is characterized by increased activity of the sodium - hydrogen exchanger ( NHE ) in the glomerulus and renal tubules , which contributes importantly to the development of nephropathy."
29227582,"Despite the established role played by the exchanger in experimental studies , it has not been specifically targeted by those seeking to develop novel pharmacological treatments for diabetes."
29227582,This review demonstrates that many existing drugs that are commonly prescribed to patients with diabetes act on the NHE1 and NHE3 isoforms in the kidney.
29227582,"This action may explain their effects on sodium excretion , albuminuria and the progressive decline of glomerular function in clinical trials ; these responses can not be readily explained by the influence of these drugs on blood glucose."
29227582,"Agents that may affect the kidney in diabetes by virtue of an action on NHE include : ( 1 ) insulin and insulin sensitizers ; ( 2 ) incretin - based agents ; ( 3 ) sodium - glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors ; ( 4 ) antagonists of the renin - angiotensin system ( angiotensin converting - enzyme inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors ) ; and ( 5 ) inhibitors of aldosterone action and cholesterol synthesis ( spironolactone , amiloride and statins )."
29227582,The renal effects of each of these drug classes in patients with type 2 diabetes may be related to a single shared biological mechanism.
24170484,Purpose : To report provider adherence to standards of care for adults with type 2 diabetes before and after a quality improvement ( QI ) intervention.
24170484,Data sources : Pre - and post intervention data were abstracted from 50 medical records of patients with type 2 diabetes in a small primary care practice.
24170484,"Conclusion : There was a significant increase in the rates of foot and urine microalbumin screenings , documentation for dilated eye exams were not statistically significant."
24170484,These findings demonstrated the effectiveness of using simple practice aids to reinforce adherence to the standards of care in diabetes.
24170484,The failure to see a corresponding improvement in glycemic and blood pressure control is consistent with prior research and the need for more research in this area remain critical.
24170484,"Implications for practice : Ethnic minorities are more likely to have worse control of their diabetes and more likely to receive all their care in the primary care setting , QI interventions targeting primary care providers have the potential to reduce disparities in diabetes care."
24170484,Future research to determine whether cultural tailoring of diabetes QI interventions will produce additional benefits above those of generic diabetes QI interventions are needed.
9609356,"Over 30 years after the original description of Randle 's cycle , the mechanisms by which elevated circulating non-esterified fatty acids might be causally related to glucose intolerance in Type 2 diabetes mellitus remain uncertain."
9609356,This review examines the evidence that elevated plasma NEFA can inhibit glucose - stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic beta - cells and impair glucose - and insulin - stimulated glucose disposal by peripheral tissues.
9609356,Experimental evidence beginning to examine the mechanisms of these phenomena is discussed.
25266304,"Background : Despite advances in medicine , health systems in Latin America are not coping with the challenges of chronic diseases."
25266304,Incidence of disease and the economic burdens as a consequence have both increased in recent years.
25266304,"We have chosen Type 2 diabetes as an example to highlight the challenges posed by chronic diseases , in terms of the epidemiological transition and the economic burden of the demand for services to treat such problems."
25266304,Discussion : Current health systems are not prepared to respond in a comprehensive manner to all phases of the natural history of the disease.
25266304,"There are new models of universal coverage , but resources and models of care are focused on programs aimed at healing / rehabilitation , and very sparsely at detection / prevention."
25266304,"Summary : In this scenario , chronic problems have alarmingly increased direct costs ( medical care ) and indirect costs ( temporary disability , permanent disability and premature mortality )."
25266304,"If more resources are not assigned to preventive medicine , these trends , in addition to not meeting the needs of the population , will financially collapse health systems and the patients ' pockets."
25266304,This Opinion piece outlines some possible changes that can be implemented to better prepare the health services in Latin American countries.
19531025,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes , a disease difficult to treat and expensive to manage , is increasing rapidly worldwide."
19531025,"It is also known that lifestyle , and particularly dietary habits , play an important role in the development of diabetes."
19531025,"Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern , like the Mediterranean diet , exerts a beneficial role regarding the development of diabetes."
19531025,"Additionally certain individual food groups and components of the diet , such as monounsaturated fatty acids , fruits , vegetables , whole grain cereals , dietary fiber , fish and moderate consumption of alcohol , also may protect against the development of diabetes , possibly through the amelioration of insulin sensitivity and their anti-inflammatory actions."
19531025,"Unfortunately , dietary habits in the developed world are changing towards an unhealthier direction."
19531025,"Consequently , emphasis should be given on encouraging at population and individual level for adopting a healthier lifestyle , including dietary habits , in order to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes."
23402449,This review outlines the effect of depression on quality of life ( QoL ) in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ).
23402449,"The prevalence and medical , psychological and financial burden of T2DM in the USA are briefly discussed , similar to the findings related to patients living with T2DM and depression in terms of health - related QoL."
23402449,"Recommendations for future research include studying mechanisms by which depression affects the QoL of T2DM patients , outlining effects of positive emotions on managing consequences of distress and depression in these patients , and developing interventions to address both depression and diabetes that minimize the treatment burden and costs for patients."
2648356,"Type II diabetes is a challenge , not only because it is complex to treat but also because many physicians and patients do not appreciate the seriousness of the disease and thus do not undertake therapy aggressively."
2648356,Only with the recognition that treatment and follow - up monitoring of type II diabetes require the same careful approach as type I diabetes can physicians be assured that these patients are getting the best care.
29783049,Background : Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is a socially significant disease that affects millions of patients.
29783049,"There were an estimated 366 million people with this disease in 2011 , and , according to the forecast , approximately 552 million will be affected by this disease in 2030."
29783049,It is well known that the primary diagnosis and treatment of a patient with this disease are quite expensive.
29783049,What should be done to make it possible for a patient to monitor his own state and provide treatment in his own home using telemedicine?
29783049,"To solve this problem , an alternative concept for the diagnosis , monitoring , and treatment at the basis of traditional Chinese medicine combined with mathematical methods of data processing has been used."
29783049,"Methods / design : To assess the pattern thresholds of acupuncture channels of heat sensitivity in patients with T2D , the Akabane test was performed on 160 men and 243 women ( total 696 tests ) , including the dynamics of surveillance."
29783049,"For comparison , a group of healthy individuals comprising 116 men and 277 women also participated."
29783049,"Results : It was found that the main difference between patients with T2D and the healthy individuals is the presence of a pronounced asymmetry between the right and left branches of the canals , primarily in the digestive system."
29783049,"At the same time , the level of asymmetry increases with the increase in the glycemic level."
29783049,This dependence allows for the early diagnosis of T2D.
29783049,"Moreover , a targeted stimulation of the definite channels with a high level of asymmetry based on the individual calculations can decrease the glycemic level."
29783049,Conclusion : The combination of the Akabane test with the use of mathematical analysis in patients with T2D makes it possible to trace the entire chain of carbohydrate metabolism at an individual level and to identify the compensatory mechanisms for more effective treatment of reflexotherapy methods.
29783049,This kind of treatment and monitoring can also be performed by the patient independently in his own home.
24523032,Organisms have evolved to survive rigorous environments and are not prepared to thrive in a world of caloric excess and sedentary behavior.
24523032,A realization that physical exercise ( or lack of it ) plays a pivotal role in both the pathogenesis and therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2DM ) has led to the provocative concept of therapeutic exercise mimetics.
24523032,"A decade ago , we attempted to simulate the beneficial effects of exercise by treating t2DM patients with 3 weeks of daily hyperthermia , induced by hot tub immersion."
24523032,"The short - term intervention had remarkable success , with a 1 % drop in HbA1 , a trend toward weight loss , and improvement in diabetic neuropathic symptoms."
24523032,An explanation for the beneficial effects of exercise and hyperthermia centers upon their ability to induce the cellular stress response ( the heat shock response ) and restore cellular homeostasis.
24523032,"Impaired stress response precedes major metabolic defects associated with t2DM and may be a near seminal event in the pathogenesis of the disease , tipping the balance from health into disease."
24523032,"Heat shock protein inducers share metabolic pathways associated with exercise with activation of AMPK , PGC1 - a , and sirtuins."
24523032,"Diabetic therapies that induce the stress response , whether via heat , bioactive compounds , or genetic manipulation , improve or prevent all of the morbidities and comorbidities associated with the disease."
24523032,"The agents reduce insulin resistance , inflammatory cytokines , visceral adiposity , and body weight while increasing mitochondrial activity , normalizing membrane structure and lipid composition , and preserving organ function."
24523032,Therapies restoring the stress response can re-tip the balance from disease into health and address the multifaceted defects associated with the disease.
23623209,"This narrative review examines the concept of diabetes as a cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk equivalent , the rationale and approaches to absolute CVD risk estimation in type 2 diabetes."
23623209,"In people with diabetes , CVD risk follows a gradient."
23623209,Reliably capturing this gradient depends on the combination of several risk factors.
23623209,Existing CVD risk tools applicable to people with diabetes have shown a modest - to - acceptable performance.
23623209,Future improvements may include updating existing models or constructing new ones with improved predictive accuracy.
23623209,"Ultimately , developed models should be tested in independent populations , and the impact of their uptake on clinical decision making and the outcome of care assessed."
23868079,Background / aims : It is widely accepted that type 2 diabetes is caused by an interaction of both lifestyle and genetic factors.
23868079,"However , the impact of explaining disease aetiology as primarily genetic or environmental is relatively unexplored for common chronic multi-factorial conditions."
23868079,This study investigates whether perceiving the cause of type 2 diabetes as primarily genetic or environmental influences attitudes towards the controllability of the condition.
23868079,"Methods : Using a between - participants vignette - based experimental survey design , 200 participants aged 40 years and above from a primary care setting responded to a vignette which implied the cause of diabetes as being predominantly genetic or environmental."
23868079,"Attitudes towards personal responsibility , prevention and treatment were measured using an attitude questionnaire."
23868079,"Results : There was a significant interaction effect between perceived aetiology and family history on attitude to treatment ; participants with a family history of type 2 diabetes perceived treatment as less effective if they read the genetic vignette , but those without a family history did not ( p < 0.05 )."
23868079,The findings also indicated that an individual was perceived as less responsible for the development of type 2 diabetes ( p < 0.05 ) when participants ( regardless of family history ) read a vignette with an implied genetic causation.
23868079,Conclusion : Awareness by health professionals of the impact of genetic attributions in disease aetiology is fundamental when encouraging positive attitudes to personal responsibility for lifestyle change and treatment for the condition.
23868079,These findings may impact the way preventative health messages are tailored to people depending on their family history of diabetes.
22369258,The aim of this review is to examine the current scientific knowledge on the relationship between diet and Type 2 diabetes and consider further implications for public health.
22369258,The review focuses on the main nutritional elements which have been identified as significant in the prevention and management of Type 2 diabetes.
22369258,"Research findings on the role of carbohydrate , fiber , alcohol , and individual fatty acids are discussed , while the role of specific micro-nutrients and the influence of obesity are comprehensively presented."
22369258,"The association between dietary habits and Type 2 diabetes etiology and management is also reviewed , in order to examine the positive effects of adherence to a healthy dietary pattern , including the plausible role of the Mediterranean diet."
24292896,Patient trust in personal medical information is critical to increasing adherence to physician recommendations and medications.
24292896,"One of the anticipated benefits of learning of one 's genomic risk for common diseases is the increased adoption of screening , preventive care and lifestyle changes."
24292896,"However , the equivocal results thus far reported of the positive impact of knowledge of genomic risk on behavior change may be due to lack of patients ' trust in the results."
24292896,"As part of a clinical study to compare two methods of communication of genomic risk results for Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , we assessed patients ' trust and preferred methods of delivery of genomic risk information."
24292896,"A total of 300 participants recruited from the general public in Durham , NC were randomized to receive their genomic risk for T2DM in - person from a genetic counselor or online through the testing company 's web - site."
24292896,Participants completed a baseline survey and three follow - up surveys after receiving results.
24292896,"Overall , participants reported high levels of trust in the test results."
24292896,Participants who received their results in - person from the genetic counselor were significantly more likely to trust their results than those who reviewed their results on - line ( p = 0.005 ).
24292896,"There was not a statistically significant difference in levels of trust among participants with increased genetic risk , as compared to other those with decreased or same as population risk ( p = 0.1154 )."
24292896,"In the event they undergo genomic risk testing again , 55 % of participants overall indicated they would prefer to receive their results online compared to 28 % that would prefer to receive future results in - person."
24292896,"Of those participants preferring to receive results online , 77 % indicated they would prefer to have the option to speak to someone if they had questions with the online results ( compared to accessing results online without the option of professional consultation )."
24292896,This is the first study to assess satisfaction with genomic risk testing by the method of delivery of the test result.
24292896,The higher rate of trust in results delivered in - person suggests that online access reports may not result in serious consideration of results and lack of adoption of recommended preventive recommendations.
24299125,"Background : With an estimated 74 % of all deaths attributable to non-communicable diseases ( NCDs ) in 2010 , NCDs have become a major health priority in Brazil."
24299125,"The objective of the study was to conduct a comprehensive literature review on diabetes in Brazil ; specifically : the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes , the availability of national and regional sources of data ( particularly in terms of direct and indirect costs ) and health policies for the management of diabetes and its complications."
24299125,Methods : A literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify articles containing information on diabetes in Brazil.
24299125,"Official documents from the Brazilian government and the World Health Organization , as well as other grey literature and official government websites were also reviewed."
24299125,"Results : From 2006 to 2010 , an approximate 20 % increase in the prevalence of self - reported diabetes was observed."
24299125,"In 2010 , it was estimated that 6.3 % of Brazilians aged 18 years or over had diabetes."
24299125,"Diabetes was estimated to be responsible for 278,778 years of potential life lost for every 100,000 people."
24299125,"In 2013 , it is estimated that about 7 % of patients with diabetes has had one or more of the following complications : diabetic foot ulcers , amputation , kidney disease , and fundus changes."
24299125,The estimated annual direct cost of diabetes was USD $ 3.952 billion in 2000 ; the estimated annual indirect cost was USD $ 18.6 billion.
24299125,The two main sources of data on diabetes are the information systems of the Ministry of Health and surveys.
24299125,"In the last few years , the Brazilian Ministry of Health has invested considerably in improving surveillance systems for NCDs as well as implementing specific programmes to improve diagnosis and access to treatment."
24299125,"Conclusions : Brazil has the capacity to address and respond to NCDs due to the leadership of the Ministry of Health in NCD prevention activities , including an integrated programme currently in place for diabetes."
24299125,Strengthening the surveillance of NCDs is a national priority along with recognising the urgent need to invest in improving the coverage and quality of mortality data.
24299125,It is also essential to conduct regular surveys of risk factors on a national scale in order to design effective preventive strategies.
21133214,"This article discusses type 2 diabetes , including the underlying causes and the treatment algorithm needed to manage this condition."
21133214,The article also explores the educational opportunities available to encourage self - management of this chronic life long condition.
21034605,Background : There is no agreement as to whether intensive glucose control in type 2 diabetes can reduce the incidence of macrovascular events in these patients.
21034605,We performed a meta - analysis comparing intensive glucose control or conventional glucose control in randomized controlled trials.
21034605,"Methods : Databases including MEDLINE , EMBASE , and Cochrane controlled trials register , the Cochrane Library , and Science Citation Index were searched to find relevant trials."
21034605,Outcome measures were the incidence of major macrovascular events.
21034605,Results : Six trials involving 28 065 patients were included.
21034605,"Analysis suggested that there was an obviously decreased incidence of major macrovascular events in patients having intensive glucose treatment vs. controls ( RR 0.92 ; 95 % CI 0.87 , 0.98 ; P = 0.005 )."
21034605,"However , intensive glycemia control strategies in type 2 diabetes showed no significant impact on the incidence of death from any cause compared with conventional glycemia control strategies , intensive 14.7 % , controls 12.0 % ( RR 0.95 ; 95 % CI 0.80 , 1.12 ; P = 0.55 ) , as well as on the incidence of cardiovascular death , intensive 3.7 % , controls 3.6 % ( RR 1.10 , 95 % CI 0.79 , 1.53 ; P = 0.57 )."
21034605,"Conclusions : Control of glycemia to normal ( or near normal levels ) in type 2 diabetes appears to be effective in reducing the incidence of major macrovascular events , but there were no significant differences of either the mortality from any cause or from cardiovascular death between the two glycemia - control strategies."
19425874,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by the progressive loss of beta cell function , which occurs after many years of insulin resistance."
19425874,"Within this definition , clinicians may see a diverse array of presentations , suggesting different proportions of these two pathogenic factors and a complex etiology."
19425874,"There are also differences in the rate of type 2 diabetes progression in each patient , so treatments must be reviewed frequently to respond to changing severity of pathophysiologies."
19425874,This article first considers some of the heritable factors and the pathogenic heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes.
19425874,"Relevant socioeconomic and demographic factors influencing disease development are reviewed after that , while emphasizing how a patient 's treatment requires changes over time."
15056594,Background : Diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder characterised by persistent hyperglycaemia.
15056594,The prevalence of diabetes is increased in people with schizophrenia.
15056594,Aims : To provide an update of current thinking in diabetes for practising psychiatrists.
15056594,Method : Literature review.
15056594,"Results : Diabetes is a costly condition in individual , social and economic terms , and the global burden of diabetes is increasing in most populations."
15056594,The insidious onset and asymptomatic nature of diabetes results in many people remaining undiagnosed and at great risk of developing life - threatening vascular complications.
15056594,Lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can reduce incident diabetes and delay its progression.
15056594,Conclusions : Public health policies are urgently required to encourage people to follow a healthy lifestyle.
15056594,"Primary prevention strategies for diabetes should target individuals at especially high risk of developing type 2 diabetes , including those with severe mental illness."
24399094,The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of diabetes genetic counseling on attitudes toward diabetes and its heredity in relatives of type 2 diabetes patients.
24399094,"This study was an unmasked , randomized controlled trial at a medical check - up center in Japan."
24399094,Subjects in this study are healthy adults between 30 and 60 years of age who have a family history of type 2 diabetes in their first degree relatives.
24399094,Participants in the intervention group received a brief genetic counseling session for approximately 10 min.
24399094,Genetic counseling was structured based on the Health Belief Model.
24399094,Both intervention and control groups received a booklet for general diabetes prevention.
24399094,"Risk perception and recognition of diabetes , and attitude towards its prevention were measured at baseline , 1 week and 1 year after genetic counseling."
24399094,Participants who received genetic counseling showed significantly higher recognition about their sense of control over diabetes onset than control group both at 1 week and 1 year after the session.
24399094,"On the other hand , anxiety about diabetes did not change significantly."
24399094,The findings show that genetic counseling for diabetes at a medical check center helped adults with diabetes family history understand they are able to exert control over the onset of their disease through lifestyle modification.
7813802,Type II diabetes remains a genetic nightmare.
7813802,"The major problem is identifying suitable pedigrees , sib - pairs , and populations for study."
7813802,"Segregation analysis data suggest that type II diabetes is likely to be polygenic , although one or more major genes could also be involved."
7813802,This and the high prevalence of diabetes affect the strategies for searching for genetic mutations.
7813802,Linkage analysis in classical type II diabetes pedigrees is unlikely to be successful.
7813802,"In addition , affected sib - pair analysis is limited because both parents are often affected , leading to bilineal inheritance."
7813802,"Sib - pairs with both parents alive are unusual , so identity by descent analysis is rarely feasible."
7813802,Strategies to reduce bilineal inheritance by identifying sib - pairs with one known nondiabetic parent or with the second sibling having mild subclinical diabetes may be worthwhile.
7813802,"Identification of individuals or pedigrees with an unusual phenotype that suggests a single gene disorder , such as maturity - onset diabetes of the young , will continue to be important , for this allows linkage analysis with markers near candidate genes and exclusion mapping of chromosomal regions using highly polymorphic markers."
7813802,"Population association studies with candidate genes can detect mutations that have a minor role in the majority proportion of diabetic subjects , but large numbers are required and great care must be taken to exclude ethnic group differences between the diabetic and normoglycemic populations."
7813802,"The study of small inbred communities might be helpful because they may have fewer diabetogenic genes than outbred populations , and this would increase the power of sib - pair and population association studies."
7813802,Direct screening for mutations in candidate genes ( with single - strand conformation polymorphism or heteroduplex screening or with direct sequencing ) in patients with the appropriate pathophysiological abnormality can be a successful strategy.
7813802,"The identification of well - defined diabetic pedigrees , sib - pairs , and suitable matched diabetic and nondiabetic populations will be key to the discovery of the genes for diabetes."
12050271,"To investigate whether quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ( QUICKI ) would be useful as an index of insulin resistance during the clinical course of type 2 diabetes mellitus , correlation between QUICKI and the index of the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp study [ clamp insulin resistance ( clamp IR ) ] was evaluated in 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus before and after treatment."
12050271,"The therapy program consisted of diet ( 1440 - 1720 kcal / d ) and exercise ( walking 10,000 steps daily ) for 6 wk."
12050271,"QUICKI and clamp IR were significantly correlated before ( r = 0.598 , P < 0.0001 ) and after ( r = 0.583 , P < 0.0001 ) treatment."
12050271,"Neither the slope nor the intercept of the linear correlation between QUICKI and clamp IR measured before treatment was significantly different from those measured after treatment ( slopes ; F = 0.002 , P = 0.96 , intercepts ; F = 2.65 , P = 0.11 )."
12050271,"During treatment , the values of both QUICKI ( 8 % change ; P < 0.0001 ) and clamp IR ( 38 % change ; P < 0.0001 ) significantly increased and their changes were significantly correlated ( r = 0.415 , P < 0.01 )."
12050271,"In conclusion , QUICKI may become a useful method for the follow - up of insulin resistance during the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
29417379,"Background : Diabetes is associated with complications , including coronary heart disease , stroke , kidney failure , blindness and amputation , and ultimately is a major cause of disability and death worldwide."
29417379,Adherence to best practice guidelines is limited in unstructured diabetes management in primary care settings.
29417379,"Aims : This study aims to establish what data was being collected in general practice prior to the introduction of the Cycle of Care , which is a proactive model of diabetes management introduced in Ireland."
29417379,Methods : Medical students in general practices with the University of Limerick Graduate Entry Medical School and their supervisors used practice software to collect quantitative data from the clinical records of patients with T2DM.
29417379,Results : The sample included 2696 patients with T2DM who had visited their GP in the previous year.
29417379,"During the 12 months studied , 18.5 % of patients with T2DM attended an emergency department and 24 % were admitted to hospital."
29417379,"The results of the documentation of three modifiable risk factors associated with T2DM were as follows : 49.5 % had BMI documented , 51.7 % had smoking status documented and 33.9 % had alcohol consumption documented."
29417379,Two hundred and fifty people were diagnosed with T2DM in the previous 12 months.
29417379,"Of these , 19 % had been referred to a chiropodist and 23 % to a dietician."
29417379,Conclusions : This study provides a comprehensive snapshot of care in Irish general practice for patients with T2DM prior to the introduction of the Cycle of Care.
29417379,Future research must investigate the impact of Cycle of Care on patient care in general practice.
25345504,"The increasing worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and associated neurological disorders ( NDs ) , such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson 's disease , have raised concerns about increasing health care and financial burden."
25345504,"Due to the overwhelming growth rate of T2DM and its strong association with NDs , there is an ever - growing and an urgent need to improve the diagnosis and management of the disease."
25345504,"Major hurdles in the management of T2DM comprise of striving for glycemic targets , polypharmacy , patient adherence and clinical inertia."
25345504,"The challenges occurring in the treatment of T2DM are mainly attributed to the complex heterogeneous nature of the disease and its close association with a wide variety of neurological , metabolic and cardiovascular disorders."
25345504,"To overcome these challenges , authors propose to focus on the treatment strategies that employ shared pathogenesis and common molecular denominators involved in the aetiology of T2DM and associated NDs."
25345504,"Impaired insulin signalling ( as a result of perturbed redox status ) , insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction are key molecular events that may lead to the pathogenesis of T2DM and associated NDs."
25345504,"However , effective management of these therapeutic strategies requires holistic experimental evidence from animal as well as clinical human studies."
25345504,"Therefore , a shift in the treatment paradigm from single point glycemic control to shared pathogenesis control would be an ideal approach to combat the alarming progression of diabetes and associated NDs."
25345504,"Therapeutic interventions focused on shared molecular pathogenesis , along with effective glycemic control , may provide protection from associated NDs."
18413226,"Using a path model , this study examined the relationships among psychosocial factors ( social support and acceptance of diabetes ) , knowledge of the disease , perceived difficulty of self - care behaviors ( SCBs ) , and disease outcome [ quality of life ( QoL ) ] among 180 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
18413226,"In general , respondents exhibited high levels of acceptance."
18413226,The hypothesis that higher levels of social support and acceptance lead to lower perceived difficulty with SCBs was supported.
18413226,High levels of social support increased acceptance and reduced SCBs.
18413226,Knowledge reduced SCBs but was not associated with QoL.
18413226,"In the path model , SCBs influenced QoL and mediated the relationship between social support , acceptance , and QoL."
22972441,"Faced with a global epidemic of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , it is critical that researchers improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of T2D and related vascular complications."
22972441,These findings may ultimately lead to novel treatment options for disease prevention or delaying progression.
22972441,"Two major paradigms jointly underlie the development of T2D and related coronary artery disease , diabetic nephropathy , and diabetic retinopathy."
22972441,These paradigms include the genetic risk variants and behavioral / environmental factors.
22972441,"This article systematically reviews the literature supporting genetic determinants in the pathogenesis of T2D and diabetic vasculopathy , and the functional implications of these gene variants on the regulation of beta - cell function and glucose homeostasis."
22972441,"We update the discovery of diabetes and diabetic vasculopathy risk variants , and describe the genetic technologies that have uncovered them."
22972441,"Also , genomic linkage between obesity and T2D is discussed."
22972441,There is a complementary role for behavioral and environmental factors modulating the genetic susceptibility and diabetes risk.
22972441,Epidemiological and clinical data demonstrating the effects of behavioral and novel environmental exposures on disease expression are reviewed.
22972441,"Finally , a succinct overview of recent landmark clinical trials addressing glycemic control and its impact on rates of vascular complications is presented."
22972441,It is expected that novel strategies to exploit the gene - and exposure - related underpinnings of T2D will soon result.
30928570,"Background : Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein ( A-FABP ) is a novel adipokine that contributes to the development of metabolic disorder , type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and atherosclerosis."
30928570,We determined the correlation between serum A-FABP and aortic stiffness in T2DM patients.
30928570,Methods : Fasting blood samples were obtained from 156 patients with T2DM.
30928570,Serum A-FABP concentration were determined using a commercial enzyme immunoassay.
30928570,"Carotid - femoral pulse wave velocity ( cfPWV ) was measured using SphygmoCor System , and cfPWV values of > 10 m / s were defined as high aortic stiffness."
30928570,Results : Sixty participants ( 38.4 % ) fell under the high aortic stiffness group.
30928570,"This group , compared to the control group , showed older age ( P = .004 ) , higher systolic blood pressure ( P < .001 ) , diastolic blood pressure ( P = .027 ) , urine albumin - to - creatinine ratio ( P = .003 ) , serum A-FABP ( P < .001 ) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate ( P = .001 )."
30928570,"After adjusting for factors significantly associated with aortic stiffness using multivariable logistic regression analysis , serum A-FABP [ OR = 1.029 ( 1.002 - 1.058 ) , P = .039 ] was found to be an independent predictor of aortic stiffness in T2DM patients."
30928570,Conclusions : Serum A-FABP is positively correlated with aortic arterial stiffness in patients with T2DM.
24084701,Purpose : The main purpose of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect effects of psychosocial factors on self - care behavior and glycemic control in Turkish patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
24084701,Method : The study used a cross-sectional questionnaire survey design ( N = 350 ).
24084701,Data were collected using the Summary of Diabetes Self - Care Activities Scale and the Multidimensional Diabetes Questionnaire.
24084701,The relationship between the study variables was analyzed using Pearson 's correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling.
24084701,"Results : Self - efficacy was associated with social support , outcome expectancies , perceived interference , educational level , and self - care and A1C."
24084701,"According to the structural equation model , self - efficacy was the predictor variable that influenced both self - care and glycemic control."
24084701,Conclusions : Self - efficacy in achieving desired health outcomes was found to play a central role in Turkish patients.
24084701,"Although interventions are planned and implemented to achieve and maintain self - management in individuals with diabetes , strengthening psychosocial factors , particularly self - efficacy , may contribute to adjustment to disease and good glycemic control in the long term."
23347242,Purpose : Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is a complex metabolic disorder that affects almost 24 million Americans.
23347242,"Healthcare providers often do not initiate and / or intensify therapy appropriately during patient visits , which may be due , in part , to a lack of understanding of the new diabetes medications."
23347242,This review focuses on means by which primary care nurse practitioners ( NPs ) might evaluate the utility of pharmacologic agents based upon their relation to the pathogenesis of T2DM.
23347242,"Data sources : The evidence used in developing this review included evidence - based reviews , clinical trials , cohort studies , position statements , and guidelines."
23347242,"The authors obtained relevant reports through a computerized search of the literature using PubMed , MEDLINE , and other search engines and scanning syllabi from national and international meetings on the subject of type 2 diabetes."
23347242,Conclusions : Medications used to manage T2DM utilize different pharmacologic approaches.
23347242,"These include stimulating insulin production , reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis , slowing polysaccharide digestion , and increasing insulin sensitivity in muscle , liver , and fat to achieve euglycemia."
23347242,Implications for practice : Patients with T2DM should be treated to their lowest targeted glycemic goals as soon as they are diagnosed as safely and as rationally as possible.
23347242,NPs in primary care practice can facilitate more effective diabetes management.
23802882,"Background : Limited study on the use of complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) among patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , particularly in primary - care settings."
23802882,"This study seeks to understand the prevalence , types , expenditures , attitudes , beliefs , and perceptions of CAM use among patients with DM visiting outpatient primary care clinics."
23802882,"Methods : This is a descriptive , cross-sectional study of 240 diabetic patients."
23802882,"CAM is defined as a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems , practices , and products that are not generally considered part of conventional Western medicine."
23802882,Data analysis was done using SPSS v. 19 and multiple logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of CAM use.
23802882,Results : The prevalence of CAM use was 62.5 percent.
23802882,Female were 1.8 times more likely than male in using CAM.
23802882,"Malays ( 75 % ) were the most frequent users , followed Indians ( 18 % ) and Chinese ( 6 % )."
23802882,"Biological therapy ( 50.0 % ) were the most widely used , followed by manipulative - body based systems ( 9.2 % ) , energy system ( 8.8 % ) , alternative medicine systems ( 4.6 % ) and mind - body system ( 1.7 % )."
23802882,"In biological therapy , a total of 30.4 percent , 24.2 percent , 13.3 percent , and 7.9 percent of diabetic patients consumed bitter gourd ( Momordica Charantia ) , followed by Misai Kucing ( Orthosiphon Stamineus Benth ) , garlic ( Allium Sativum ) , and Sabah snake grass ( Clinacanthus Nutans Lindau ) respectively."
23802882,The mean of the expenditure on CAM usage was RM 52.8 ± 101.9 ( US $ 16.9 ± 32.5 ) per month.
23802882,Conclusions : The prevalence of CAM use was high among diabetics.
23802882,Islam faith is predictor for CAM use among Type 2 DM patients.
23802882,"The most - common herbs used were bitter gourd ( Momordica Charantia ) and Misai Kucing ( Orthosiphon Stamineus , Benth )."
23802882,Further studies on the anti-glycemic activity of the isolated compound may be needed in the future.
22540253,Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is thought to arise from the complex interplay of both genetic and environmental factors.
22540253,"Since the advent of genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) , we have seen considerable progress in our understanding of the role that genetics and gene - environment interactions play in the development of T2D."
22540253,"Recent work suggests that the adverse effect of several T2D loci may be abolished or at least attenuated by higher physical activity levels or healthy lifestyle , whereas low physical activity and dietary factors characterizing a Western dietary pattern may augment it."
22540253,"However , there still remain inconsistencies warranting further investigation."
22540253,Lack of statistical power and measurement errors for the environmental factors continue to challenge our efforts for characterizing interactions.
22540253,"Although our recent focus on established T2D loci is reasonable , we may be overlooking many other potential loci not captured by recent T2D GWAS."
22540253,"Agnostic approaches to the discovery of gene and environment interactions may address this possibility , but their application to the field is currently limited and still faces conceptual challenges."
22540253,"Nonetheless , continued investment in gene - environment interaction studies through large collaborative efforts holds promise in furthering our understanding of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors."
28222533,Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is a major subtype of diabetes and is usually diagnosed at a young age with insulin deficiency.
28222533,"The life expectancy of T1DM patients has increased substantially in comparison with that three decades ago due to the availability of exogenous insulin , though it is still shorter than that of healthy people."
28222533,"However , the relation remains unclear between T1DM and dementia as an aging - related disease."
28222533,"We conducted a systematic review of existing literature on T1DM and cognition impairments by carrying out searches in electronic databases Medline , EMBASE , and Google Scholar."
28222533,We restricted our review to studies involving only human subjects and excluded studies on type 2 diabetes mellitus or non-classified diabetes.
28222533,A meta - analysis was first performed on the relationship between T1DM and cognitive changes in youths and adults respectively.
28222533,"Then the review focused on the cognitive complications of T1DM and their relation with the characteristics of T1DM , glycemic control , diabetic complications , comorbidities , and others."
28222533,"First , age at onset , disease duration , and glycemic dysregulation were delineated for their association with cognitive changes."
28222533,"Then diabetic ketoacidosis , angiopathy , and neuropathy were examined as diabetic complications for their involvement in cognitive impairments."
28222533,"Lastly , body mass index and blood pressure were discussed for their relations with the cognitive changes."
28222533,Future studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of T1DM - related cognitive impairments or dementia.
31534209,Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) results from the destruction of pancreatic β - cells that is mediated by the immune system.
31534209,Multiple genetic and environmental factors found in variable combinations in individual patients are involved in the development of T1DM.
31534209,"Genetic risk is defined by the presence of particular allele combinations , which in the major susceptibility locus ( the HLA region ) affect T cell recognition and tolerance to foreign and autologous molecules."
31534209,Multiple other loci also regulate and affect features of specific immune responses and modify the vulnerability of β - cells to inflammatory mediators.
31534209,"Compared with the genetic factors , environmental factors that affect the development of T1DM are less well characterized but contact with particular microorganisms is emerging as an important factor."
31534209,"Certain infections might affect immune regulation , and the role of commensal microorganisms , such as the gut microbiota , are important in the education of the developing immune system."
31534209,Some evidence also suggests that nutritional factors are important.
31534209,Multiple islet - specific autoantibodies are found in the circulation from a few weeks to up to 20 years before the onset of clinical disease and this prediabetic phase provides a potential opportunity to manipulate the islet - specific immune response to prevent or postpone β - cell loss.
31534209,The latest developments in understanding the heterogeneity of T1DM and characterization of major disease subtypes might help in the development of preventive treatments.
30372820,Background : Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by T cell - mediated self - destruction of insulin - secreting islet β cells.
30372820,Management of T1DM is challenging and complicated especially with conventional medications.
30372820,Gene therapy has emerged as one of the potential therapeutic alternatives to treat T1DM.
30372820,This review primarily focuses on the current status and the future perspectives of gene therapy in the management of T1DM.
30372820,A vast number of the studies which are reported on gene therapy for the management of T1DM are done in animal models and in preclinical studies.
30372820,"In addition , the safety of such therapies is yet to be established in humans."
30372820,"Currently , there are several gene level interventions that are being investigated , notably , overexpression of genes and proteins needed against T1DM , transplantation of cells that express the genes against T1DM , stem - cells mediated gene therapy , genetic vaccination , immunological precursor cell - mediated gene therapy and vectors."
30372820,"Methods : We searched the current literature through searchable online databases , journals and other library sources using relevant keywords and search parameters."
30372820,"Only relevant publications in English , between the years 2000 and 2018 , with evidences and proper citations , were considered."
30372820,The publications were then analyzed and segregated into several subtopics based on common words and content.
30372820,A total of 126 studies were found suitable for this review.
30372820,"Findings : Generally , the pros and cons of each of the gene - based therapies have been discussed based on the results collected from the literature."
30372820,"However , there are certain interventions that require further detailed studies to ensure their effectiveness."
30372820,"We have also highlighted the future direction and perspectives in gene therapy , which , researchers could benefit from."
31584373,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) , an autoimmune disorder , is becoming widespread with approximately 97,700 children in India and 490,000 children worldwide affected."
31584373,There are various etiological factors contributing to the expansion of its incidence on different geographical locations.
31584373,"Hence , the articles published in reputed journals were studies and data were collected for analyzing the etiology and prevention of T1DM."
31584373,It has been observed that hybrid insulin peptides act as key antigens for the autoreactive T cells and cause the loss of self - tolerance in humans.
31584373,The association of coxsackievirus B has been observed with the onset of T1DM.
31584373,Accurate identification of the trigger can lead to the development of appropriate preventive measures.
31584373,It can become a base for advance studies to prevent T1DM in humans.
31584373,This review will highlight the causes and some preventive actions which can be considered to eliminate T1DM.
29916386,Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by insulin deficiency and resultant hyperglycaemia.
29916386,"Knowledge of type 1 diabetes has rapidly increased over the past 25 years , resulting in a broad understanding about many aspects of the disease , including its genetics , epidemiology , immune and β - cell phenotypes , and disease burden."
29916386,"Interventions to preserve β cells have been tested , and several methods to improve clinical disease management have been assessed."
29916386,"However , wide gaps still exist in our understanding of type 1 diabetes and our ability to standardise clinical care and decrease disease - associated complications and burden."
29916386,This Seminar gives an overview of the current understanding of the disease and potential future directions for research and care.
20723815,This article describes the epidemiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D ) around the world and across the lifespan.
20723815,"Epidemiologic patterns of T1D by demographic , geographic , biologic , cultural , and other factors in populations are presented to gain insight about the causes , natural history , risks , and complications of T1D."
20723815,Data from large epidemiologic studies worldwide indicate that the incidence of T1D has been increasing by 2 % to 5 % worldwide and that the prevalence of T1D is approximately 1 in 300 in the United States by 18 years of age.
20723815,Research on risk factors for T1D is an active area of research to identify genetic and environmental triggers that could potentially be targeted for intervention.
20723815,"Although significant advances have been made in the clinical care of T1D with resultant improvements in quality of life and clinical outcomes , much more needs to be done to improve care of , and ultimately find a cure for , T1D."
20723815,"Epidemiologic studies have an important ongoing role to investigate the complex causes , clinical care , prevention , and cure of T1D."
24070892,"Type 1 diabetes is a complex disease involving a combination of factors , such as genetic susceptibility , immunologic dysregulation and exposure to environmental triggers."
24070892,Animal models serve an important function both in elucidating the pathophysiology and preliminary screening of antidiabetic molecules.
24070892,"Hence , the development of models for type 1 diabetes can be broadly divided into 3 categories , namely : identification of spontaneously developing type 1 diabetes mellitus strains , creating diabetes - prone species through gene transfer techniques and forced destruction of islet cells through chemical or surgical means."
24070892,This review discusses the models used to study type 1 diabetes with special emphasis on genetics.
27020257,Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is caused by progressive autoimmune - mediated loss of pancreatic β - cell mass via apoptosis.
27020257,The onset of T1DM depends on environmental factors that interact with predisposing genes to induce an autoimmune assault against β cells.
27020257,"Epidemiological , clinical and pathology studies in humans support viral infection -- particularly by enteroviruses ( for example , coxsackievirus ) -- as an environmental trigger for the development of T1DM."
27020257,"Many candidate genes for T1DM , such as MDA5 , PTPN2 and TYK2 , regulate antiviral responses in both β cells and the immune system."
27020257,Cellular permissiveness to viral infection is modulated by innate antiviral responses that vary among different tissues or cell types.
27020257,"Some data indicate that pancreatic islet α cells trigger a more efficient antiviral response to infection with diabetogenic viruses than do β cells , and so are able to eradicate viral infections without undergoing apoptosis."
27020257,"This difference could account for the varying ability of islet - cell subtypes to clear viral infections and explain why chronically infected pancreatic β cells , but not α cells , are targeted by an autoimmune response and killed during the development of T1DM."
27020257,These issues and attempts to target viral infection as a preventive therapy for T1DM are discussed in the present Review.
30799818,Late diagnosis and lack of access to insulin contribute most to the mortality of people with type 1 diabetes.
30799818,The presence of this chronic noncommunicable disease is not bound by borders or even continents.
30799818,"Without treatment , it is fatal , while with treatment and good control , it is possible to prevent acute complications ( hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia ) and to reduce severe late complications ( cardiovascular and cerebrovascular , kidney failure and blindness )."
30799818,Access to equipment and supplies for diagnosis and to essential drugs for hospitals and later families at an affordable price is critical to mortality and morbidity in Africa.
30799818,Intensive training of professionals in the field and in hospitals to recognize and treat this disease is necessary.
30799818,"These factors , together with intensive education of patients and their families , can reduce the mortality and morbidity of diabetes."
30799818,"Adequate management of diabetes , an important noncommunicable disease , will contribute to meeting the Sustainable Developments Goals and reducing infant mortality."
20432533,Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder afflicting millions of people worldwide.
20432533,"Once diagnosed , patients require lifelong insulin treatment and can experience numerous disease - associated complications."
20432533,The last decade has seen tremendous advances in elucidating the causes and treatment of the disease based on extensive research both in rodent models of spontaneous diabetes and in humans.
20432533,"Integrating these advances has led to the recognition that the balance between regulatory and effector T cells determines disease risk , timing of disease activation , and disease tempo."
20432533,"Here we describe current progress , the challenges ahead and the new interventions that are being tested to address the unmet need for preventative or curative therapies."
30336709,Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is a chronic disease characterized by the destruction of insulin - producing β - cells of the pancreas.
30336709,The current paradigm in this disease 's etiopathogenesis points toward the interplay of genetic and environmental factors.
30336709,"Among the environmental variables , dietary factors , intestinal microbiota , toxins , and psychological stress have been implicated in disease onset."
30336709,"Areas covered : This review aims to investigate the relationship between psychological stress and T1DM by presenting evidence from epidemiological studies , animal models , and to provide the mechanism involved in this association."
30336709,The literature search was conducted through PubMed to identify studies that investigate the connection between stress and T1DM.
30336709,"Experimental designs , such as case - control , and retrospective and prospective cohorts studies , were included."
30336709,"Expert commentary : A wide array of evidence , ranging from epidemiological to animal models , points toward the role of psychological stressors in T1DM pathogenesis."
30336709,"Various mechanisms have been proposed , including the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis , influence of the nervous system on immune cells , and insulin resistance."
30336709,Further research could investigate the gene - stress interactions to evaluate the risk of T1DM development.
16847277,Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin - producing beta cells in the pancreas.
16847277,"Genetic and , as yet undefined , environmental factors act together to precipitate the disease."
16847277,The excess mortality associated with the complications of type 1 diabetes and the increasing incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes emphasize the importance of therapeutic strategies to prevent this chronic disorder.
16847277,Why is it considered that type 1 diabetes might be preventable?
16847277,Different strands of diabetes research are coming together to suggest therapeutic targets.
16847277,Islet cell autoantibody assays make it possible to accurately identify people at risk of future disease.
16847277,"In most cases , a long prodrome provides a window of opportunity to reverse the autoimmune process."
16847277,"Although no current "" cure "" exists , recent genetic data and preliminary trial results suggest T cells as a target for preventive strategies."
16847277,Another potentially attainable target is induction of tolerance to the beta - cell proteins such as insulin that are inappropriately recognized.
16847277,"Other strategies involve beta - cell replacement , but currently there are insufficient donor cells available."
16847277,This may be overcome as the processes controlling the differentiation of pancreatic and nonpancreatic progenitors as well as replication of existing islet beta cells are unravelled.
20412756,Recent genetic mapping and gene - phenotype studies have revealed the genetic architecture of type 1 diabetes.
20412756,At least ten genes so far can be singled out as strong causal candidates.
20412756,"The known functions of these genes indicate the primary etiological pathways of this disease , including HLA class II and I molecules binding to preproinsulin peptides and T cell receptors , T and B cell activation , innate pathogen - viral responses , chemokine and cytokine signaling , and T regulatory and antigen - presenting cell functions."
20412756,This review considers research in the field of type 1 diabetes toward identifying disease mechanisms using genetic approaches.
20412756,"The expression and functions of these pathways , and , therefore , disease susceptibility , will be influenced by epigenetic and environmental factors."
20412756,Certain inherited immune phenotypes will be early precursors of type 1 diabetes and could be useful in future clinical trials.
30045024,Background : A complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors contributes to disease etiology of most of the autoimmune disorders.
30045024,Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) and celiac disease ( CD ) are polygenic autoimmune diseases that have high propensity to coexist due to shared etiological factors like genetics and clinico - pathological overlaps.
30045024,"Summary : The mean prevalence rate for coexistence of these diseases is 8 % , and this value is a gross underestimation as reported from biopsy - proven symptomatic cases."
30045024,"The prevalence rate will rise when studies will excavate bottom layers of the "" celiac iceberg "" to detect potential and silent celiac cases."
30045024,The concomitant presence of both these disorders is a complex situation immunologically as well as clinically.
30045024,There is an accentuated breakdown of tolerance and proinflammatory cytokine storm that leads to the progression of organ - specific autoimmunity to systemic.
30045024,No immunomodulating drugs are advocated as exogenous insulin supplementation and gluten exclusion are recommended for T1DM and CD respectively.
30045024,"Nevertheless , these pose certain challenges to both the clinicians and the patients , as gluten free diet ( GFD ) has been described to have an impact on glycemic control , bone health , and vascular complications."
30045024,Also intermittent gluten intake by these patients due to non-compliance with GFD also stimulates the autoreactive immune cells that result in an augmented immune response.
30045024,Key Messages : Large public health studies are needed to estimate the prevalence of all forms of CD in T1DM patients.
30045024,"Strict global guidelines need to be formulated for the disease management and prognosis , and there is also a need for an extensive research on each front to thoroughly understand the co-occurrence of these diseases."
29929213,"Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is an autoimmune disease , which is characterized by the destruction of islet β cells in the pancreas triggered by genetic and environmental factors."
29929213,"In past decades , extensive familial and genome - wide association studies have revealed more than 50 risk loci in the genome."
29929213,"However , genetic susceptibility can not explain the increased incidence of T1D worldwide , which is very likely attributed by the growing impact of environmental factors , especially gut microbiome."
29929213,"Recently , the role of gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of T1D has been uncovered by the increasing evidence from both human subjects and animal models , strongly indicating that gut microbiome might be a pivotal hub of T1D - triggering factors , especially environmental factors."
29929213,"In this review , we summarize the current aetiological and mechanism studies of gut microbiome in T1D."
29929213,A better understanding of the role of gut microbiome in T1D may provide us with powerful prognostic and therapeutic tools in the near future.
11476858,"As our knowledge of type 1 ( insulin - dependent ) diabetes increases , so does our appreciation for the pathogenic complexity of this disease and the challenges associated with its treatment."
11476858,Many new concepts about the pathogenesis of this disorder have arisen.
11476858,"The role of genetics versus environment in disease formation has been questioned , and the basis on which type 1 diabetes is characterised and diagnosed is the subject of much debate."
11476858,"Additionally , the care and treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes has seen a rapid evolution ; with genetically engineered insulins , glucose monitoring devices , and algorithms all contributing to a decrease in disease - related complications."
11476858,"We focus this seminar on these changing views , and offer a new perspective on our understanding of the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and on principles for therapeutic management of patients with this disorder."
32342453,Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is the most common endocrine and metabolic disease caused by absolute or insufficient insulin secretion.
32342453,"Under the context of an aging population worldwide , the number of diabetic patients is increasing year by year."
32342453,Most patients with diabetes have multiple complications that severely threaten their survival and living quality.
32342453,DM is mainly divided into type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ).
32342453,"T1DM is caused by absolute lack of insulin secretion , so the current treatment for T1DM patients is exogenous insulin replacement therapy."
32342453,"At present , exercise therapy has been widely recognized in the prevention and treatment of diabetes , and regular aerobic exercise has become an important part of T1DM treatment."
32342453,"At the same time , exercise therapy is also used in conjunction with other treatments in the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications."
32342453,"However , for patients with T1DM , exercise still has the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia."
32342453,T1DM Patients and specialist physician need to fully understand the effects of exercise on metabolism and implement individualized exercise programs.
32342453,This chapter reviews the related content of exercise and T1DM.
25009119,The incidence of type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) in young children ( age < 6 years ) is rising.
25009119,"Diabetes management guidelines offered by the American Diabetes Association and health care teams understandably place a high burden of responsibility on caregivers to check young children 's blood glucose levels , administer insulin , and monitor diet and physical activity with the ultimate goal of maintaining tight glycemic control."
25009119,"Unfortunately , this tight control is needed during a vulnerable developmental period when behavior is unpredictable , T1D can be physiologically difficult to control , parenting stress can be elevated , and caregivers are strained by normal child caretaking routines."
25009119,"Despite the potentially different management needs , specific education and clinical services for managing diabetes in young children are rarely offered , and behavioral research with this young child age group has been limited in scope and quantity."
25009119,"Research findings pertinent to young children with T1D are reviewed , and potential clinical implications , as well as areas for future research , are discussed."
31533907,"Over several decades , studies have described the progression of autoimmune diabetes , from the first appearance of autoantibodies until , and after , the diagnosis of clinical disease with hyperglycaemia and insulin dependence."
31533907,"Despite the improved management of type 1 diabetes with exogenous insulin , most patients do not meet clinical glycaemic goals , and diabetes remains an important medical problem that affects children and adults."
31533907,"Clinical and preclinical studies have suggested strategies to prevent the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in people at risk , but the outcomes of previous clinical trials have not met their primary endpoints of disease prevention or delay."
31533907,The results from the TN - 10 teplizumab prevention trial show that the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes can be delayed by treatment with a FcR non-binding monoclonal antibody to CD3 in people at high risk for disease.
31533907,"This Series paper discusses how this clinical achievement raises new questions about for whom , and when , immunological strategies might be developed to prevent type 1 diabetes , and how to achieve this goal."
28913745,"Purpose of review : The purpose of this article was to review recent guideline recommendations on glycemic target , glucose monitoring , and therapeutic strategies , while providing practical recommendations for the management of medical and surgical patients with type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) admitted to critical and non-critical care settings."
28913745,"Recent findings : Studies evaluating safety and efficacy of insulin pump therapy , continuous glucose monitoring , electronic glucose management systems , and closed loop systems for the inpatient management of hyperglycemia are described."
28913745,"Due to the increased prevalence and life expectancy of patients with type 1 diabetes , a growing number of these patients require hospitalization every year."
28913745,Inpatient diabetes management is complex and is best provided by a multidisciplinary diabetes team.
28913745,"In the absence of such resource , providers and health care staff must become familiar with the features of this condition to avoid complications such as severe hyperglycemia , ketoacidosis , hypoglycemia , or glycemic variability."
28913745,We reviewed most recent guidelines and relevant literature in the topic to provide practical recommendations for the inpatient management of patients with T1D.
29944065,Purpose The aim of this review was to integrate empirical and theoretical literature on fatigue among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ).
29944065,A methodological review using an integrative approach was used.
29944065,"Databases MEDLINE via Pubmed , CINAHL , PsycINFO , and Science Direct were searched for peer - reviewed articles published in English from 2007 - 2017 , using the following search terms and Boolean operators : "" Type 1 Diabetes "" and "" Fatigue ."""
29944065,"Of 199 articles initially retrieved , 14 were chosen for inclusion."
29944065,"These articles included 13 quantitative ( 7 cross-sectional , 2 cohort , 2 secondary data analyses , 2 experimental ) and 1 qualitative phenomenology."
29944065,Fatigue was identified as one of the most troublesome symptoms reported in persons with T1DM.
29944065,"Four main themes emerged : fatigue in T1DM is multidimensional and related to psychological , physiological , situational , and sociodemographic factors."
29944065,"Conclusions Fatigue is considered a classic symptom of hyperglycemia ; however , there were minimal data to support the theory that fatigue is related to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia."
29944065,Studies on fatigue among persons with T1DM are limited to small samples and cross-sectional designs with few randomized controlled trials addressing fatigue and diabetes - related symptoms.
29944065,Evidence is conflicting regarding the onset of fatigue among persons with T1DM and the relationship between fatigue and diabetes duration.
29944065,"The prevalence of fatigue is likely influenced by disease physiology , psychological stress , and lifestyle factors , but more research is needed to confirm these relationships as causal inference is unclear."
26264336,"Type 1 diabetes is a challenging and complex disorder to manage , and this becomes more difficult when young people are beginning to experience the pleasures and effects of alcohol consumption."
26264336,"For a young person with type 1 diabetes , alcohol consumption can have harmful effects on their current and future wellbeing."
26264336,The article focuses on the effects of alcohol in type 1 diabetes and the difficulties a young person faces in maintaining glycaemic control when drinking alcohol.
26264336,"The effects of living in an alcohol permissive culture and the knowledge and risks of alcohol consumption , as well as issues associated with depression and denial are discussed."
26264336,"In addition , we aim to raise awareness of best practice guidelines for healthcare professionals to reduce short and long - term complications associated with alcohol - induced hypoglycaemia."
31343814,Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is characterized by irreversible islet β cell destruction.
31343814,"During the progression of this disease , some patients with T1DM experience a phase of remission known as honeymoon or partial remission ( PR ) that is mainly characterized by satisfactory glycemic control and the transient recovery of islet β cell function."
31343814,"This special phase is a good model for studying the mechanism of β cell protection , might serve as a proper intervention period for immunotherapy , and may be related to disease prognosis."
31343814,This special stage is highly valuable for studies aiming to identify possible targets that may be used to cure T1DM.
31343814,"An in - depth understanding of the diagnosis , epidemiology , and possible mechanisms of the PR phase is highly needed."
31343814,"In general , patients enter the PR phase approximately 3 months after starting insulin therapy , and this phase could be sustained for 6 to 9 months."
31343814,Current research increasingly focuses on the metabolic and immunological aspects to constantly update our understanding of this phase.
31343814,"This review concentrates on the PR phase of T1DM to provide a comprehensive outlook of its epidemiology , diagnostic criteria , and underlying immune metabolic mechanisms."
32421967,Autoimmune diseases occur when the body 's natural defense system fails to differentiate its own cells from the foreign cells and mistakenly attacks the healthy cells.
32421967,"Among the autoimmune diseases , the most common serious disease is the type 1 diabetes ( T1D )."
32421967,"Biomarkers like c - peptide , autoantibodies , and glycated molecules are now widely used for the early diagnosis of diabetes."
32421967,"However , the diverse nature of biomarkers and the available autoantibodies as biomarkers are not enough to differentiate the heterogeneity inherent in T1D."
32421967,Novel biomarkers have allowed the introduction of bioinformatics for assimilating the new data into clinical tools.
32421967,"Computer - aided drug design contributes to the discovery of novel autoantibodies , and molecular docking promises to enhance it."
32421967,"Moreover , the study of the pathophysiology of diabetes via molecular simulation has been proposed."
32421967,"In this review article , we focus on the characterization of the etiology , epidemiological factors , and mechanisms of hyperglycemia that induce cellular damage due to oxidative stress and proinflammatory responses."
32421967,We also decribe novel biomarkers used for the detection of β - cell destruction and diagnosis at early stages.
32421967,"Bioinformatics tools including molecular docking , sequence alignment , and homology modeling are also presented."
32421967,"This report supports researchers in drug design , in disease detection at an early phase , and in therapy development for T1D - associated complications."
29039056,Purpose of review : This review seeks to characterize emerging concepts related to disease - modifying therapy in type 1 diabetes.
29039056,"Recent findings : We begin by describing the new understanding that islet autoimmunity , as identified by the presence of islet autoantibodies , inevitably leads to clinical type 1 diabetes."
29039056,"This understanding informs the new staging paradigm for type 1 diabetes , which suggests that type 1 diabetes may be recognized and diagnosed long before symptoms develop."
29039056,"Although it is known that nearly all individuals with established islet autoimmunity will eventually develop symptomatic type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , individual characteristics such as age and biomarker profile may predict rate of disease progression and response to treatment and may therefore be used to individualize therapy."
29039056,"Key research supports the use of immunotherapy in TID , although a paradigm shift is necessary before immunotherapy may transition from clinical trials to clinical practice."
29039056,Recent and ongoing research as it relates to these concepts is described throughout.
22183128,"Research in 2011 regarding β - cell destruction , early immunointervention trials and development of late complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus have highlighted the heterogeneity of this disease."
22183128,"Patient phenotyping should be performed for the implementation of tailored therapies , especially taking into account the age at which the disease is diagnosed."
28708247,"Aim : Managing type 1 diabetes mellitus requires efficient cognitive and executive skills , and adolescents who have attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) may face specific challenges."
28708247,This study explored young people 's experiences of diabetes treatment and care.
28708247,"Method : In a population - based study , comprising 175 patients aged 5 - 16 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus in two Swedish counties , we found that eight also met criteria for ADHD."
28708247,"Six of these , aged 14.5 - 16 years , participated 2013 - 2014 in interviews that targeted aspects of their diabetes treatment."
28708247,"Conducted by two psychologists , these used the inductive qualitative , semi-structured interview format."
28708247,Results : The two boys and four girls all reported difficulties in creating routines for their diabetes treatment and that problems were aggravated during stress.
28708247,They had been criticised by their parents and the diabetes team when their blood levels indicated inadequate diabetes control.
28708247,"They requested ongoing information , involvement of their friends , group meetings and easy access to the healthcare system during difficult times."
28708247,"Conclusion : Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and concomitant ADHD faced problems with their diabetes management , especially during stressful situations."
28708247,Diabetes care provision should pay particular attention to patients with co-existing neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD.
18729155,We have entered the era of clinical trials to prevent type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ).
18729155,"Before 1922 , when insulin was first given to a patient with diabetes , a diagnosis of T1DM was considered a death sentence."
18729155,Advances in treatment for subjects with diabetes are not yet sufficient to prevent the deleterious impact of diabetes on both day - to - day activities and the early morbidity and mortality still associated with the disease.
18729155,"We now understand a great deal about blood glucose regulation and potential health complications associated with long - term T1DM , but the mystery of why , or the pathogenesis of this devastating disease , remains elusive."
18729155,Great strides toward unraveling this mystery have been made over the past several decades.
18729155,"Even without definitive answers , we are moving from the period of discovery and animal research to the era of clinical trials."
18729155,"In this review , we wish to convey the palpable excitement in the field."
18729155,It is time to determine if we can safely change the course of T1DM.
15229371,"Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by high blood glucose levels due to defects in insulin secretion , insulin action , or both."
15229371,"With the number of cases expected to increase rapidly in the years to come , diabetes is a growing health challenge worldwide."
15229371,"Of the approximately 16 million diabetics in the United States , about 1.5 million suffer from type 1 diabetes."
15229371,"In this catabolic disorder afflicting predominantly young individuals , blood insulin is almost completely absent , leading to hyperglycemia and alterations in lipid metabolism."
15229371,Type 1 diabetes is thought to be induced by a toxic or infectious insult that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals.
15229371,"With recent advances in the understanding of the involved immunology and cellular and molecular mechanisms , researchers strive to battle the disease with new preventive and corrective strategies."
14652163,"Despite decades of research , the etiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is unknown."
14652163,"Several risk factors have been associated with type 1 DM , including viral infections , genetic predisposition , nutritional factors , and chemicals."
14652163,Several investigators hypothesize that the etiologies of type 1 DM result from a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors.
14652163,In this paper we review the epidemiologic data linking enteroviruses to type 1 DM and discuss potential mechanisms of pathogenesis.
31227198,Background and purpose : To describe advanced pharmacy practice experience ( APPE ) students ' active learning engagement and changes in self - reported comfort with diabetes care activities by attending an overnight camp for children with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ).
31227198,Educational activity and setting : Fourth - year pharmacy students spend one or two weeks at an overnight camp for children ages six to 18 years with T1DM as part of their APPE and assist with diabetes care activities while participating in daily living activities.
31227198,Students complete a survey one week before and one week after camp where they self - report their comfort level performing 16 different diabetes - related tasks.
31227198,Findings : Students ( n = 21 ) participate in hands - on active learning while volunteering at a camp for children with diabetes.
31227198,"Before camp , 40 - 61 % of students reported comfort with diabetes care activities related to pharmacotherapy , monitoring , and lifestyle management."
31227198,"After camp , the percent of students reporting comfort with these tasks increased to 78 - 96 %."
31227198,"Specific items with greatest improvement were : when to monitor ketone levels ( +79 % ) , use of insulin pens and pumps ( +64 % ) , treatment of hypoglycemia ( +50 % ) , and carbohydrate counting ( +50 % )."
31227198,"Summary : By attending and participating at an overnight camp for children with T1DM , APPE students self - report gain in comfort in performing many diabetes care - related tasks."
12083947,Type 1 ( insulin - dependent ) diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease that has no cure.
12083947,"Closed - loop insulin administration strategies and approaches for replacement of the insulin - producing beta cells may offer improved treatments , which could delay or prevent diabetes complications."
12083947,"In the long run , however , prevention of type 1 diabetes in susceptible individuals represents the best chance for reducing the toll of the disease."
12083947,"Prevention of type 1 diabetes will require reliable methods for early diagnosis of predisposition to the disease , using improved genetic and serological screening on a wide scale."
12083947,Identification of the primary antigenic target ( s ) for autoimmunity will allow intervention in prediabetes stages aimed at the induction of antigen - specific tolerance.
12083947,"In addition to manipulation of the immune system , the susceptibility of beta cells to autoimmunity could be reduced."
12083947,A number of genes have been shown to increase beta - cell resistance to immune effector molecules in animal models and cultured beta - cell lines.
12083947,These genes could be used for preventive gene therapy of type 1 diabetes mellitus if expressed in beta cells prior to the onset of autoimmune destruction.
12083947,"This prospect depends on the development of safe and efficient vectors , and approaches for cell - specific targeting of these vectors to beta cells in vivo."
23296174,Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is an autoimmune disorder directed against the β cells of the pancreatic islets.
23296174,The genetic risk of the disease is linked to HLA - DQ risk alleles and unknown environmental triggers.
23296174,"In most countries , only 10 - 15 % of children or young adults newly diagnosed with T1DM have a first - degree relative with the disease."
23296174,"Autoantibodies against insulin , GAD65 , IA - 2 or the ZnT8 transporter mark islet autoimmunity."
23296174,These islet autoantibodies may already have developed in children of 1 - 3 years of age.
23296174,Immune therapy in T1DM is approached at three different stages.
23296174,Primary prevention is treatment of individuals at increased genetic risk.
23296174,"For example , one trial is testing if hydrolyzed casein milk formula reduces T1DM incidence in genetically predisposed infants."
23296174,Secondary prevention is targeted at individuals with persistent islet autoantibodies.
23296174,"Ongoing trials involve nonautoantigen - specific therapies , such as Bacillus Calmette - Guérin vaccine or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies , or autoantigen - specific therapies , including oral and nasal insulin or alum - formulated recombinant human GAD65."
23296174,"Trial interventions at onset of T1DM have also included nonautoantigen - specific approaches , and autoantigen - specific therapies , such as proinsulin peptides."
23296174,"Although long - term preservation of β - cell function has been difficult to achieve in many studies , considerable progress is being made through controlled clinical trials and animal investigations towards uncovering mechanisms of β - cell destruction."
23296174,Novel therapies that prevent islet autoimmunity or halt progressive β - cell destruction are needed.
15852446,The relationship between autoimmune diabetes or type 1 diabetes mellitus and vitamin D has been reported in the literature.
15852446,"Many factors , environmental and genetic , have been known , as risk factors , to cause both type 1 diabetes and vitamin D deficiency."
15852446,Vitamin D treatment has improved or prevented type 1 diabetes mellitus in animals and humans.
15852446,Vitamin D also has been known to protect from autoimmune diseases in animal models.
15852446,"Therefore , it would be interesting to review the role of vitamin D in type 1 diabetes mellitus."
20351698,Enteroviruses are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ).
20351698,"In this Review , the interplay between infection with enteroviruses , the immune system and host genes is discussed."
20351698,"Data from retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies strongly suggest the involvement of enteroviruses , such as coxsackievirus B , in the development of T1DM."
20351698,Enteroviral RNA and / or proteins can be detected in tissues of patients with T1DM.
20351698,Isolation of coxsackievirus B4 from the pancreas of patients with T1DM or the presence of enteroviral components in their islets strengthens the hypothesis of a relationship between the virus and the disease.
20351698,Enteroviruses can play a part in the early phase of T1DM through the infection of beta cells and the activation of innate immunity and inflammation.
20351698,"In contrast with its antiviral role , virus - induced interferon alpha can be deleterious , acting as an initiator of the autoimmunity directed against beta cells."
20351698,"Enteroviruses , through persistent and / or successive infections , can interact with the adaptive immune system."
20351698,"Host genes , such as IFIH1 , that influence susceptibility to T1DM are associated with antiviral activities."
20351698,An increased activity of the IFIH1 protein may promote the development of T1DM.
20351698,An improved knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of enterovirus infections should help to uncover preventive strategies for T1DM.
17059972,Type 1 diabetes is a tremendously challenging and complex disease for children and families to manage.
17059972,Advances in research are constantly bringing about changes in therapies and treatments with the hope of improving the quality of life for youth with type 1 diabetes and their families.
17059972,"Accurate diagnosis , education , treatment , and referral to a certified diabetes educator , endocrinologist , dietitian , social worker , and psychologist are needed to provide the child with the skills necessary to manage diabetes over a lifetime."
17059972,Nurses and nurse practitioners must be informed of the most current treatments and research available for their patients so that they can encourage their patients to live full and healthy lives.
17940453,Purpose of review : Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is characterized by autoimmune - mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells culminating in absolute insulin deficiency.
17940453,Despite enhanced knowledge of the natural history of type 1 diabetes we have yet to develop an intervention to consistently and safely prevent or reverse type 1 diabetes.
17940453,"This review explores the lessons learned from recent type 1 diabetes interventional studies , sets out controversial issues and seeks to provide a roadmap for future interventions."
17940453,"Recent findings : The type 1 diabetes intervention studies of the 1980s demonstrated potential for preserving c - peptide , but were abandoned due to unacceptable side - effect profiles of the agents being used."
17940453,Pilot studies of new immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents with improved side - effect profiles have recently demonstrated promise in preserving c - peptide in new - onset type 1 diabetes patients.
17940453,"Several of these agents , including insulin , anti-CD3 , mycophenolate mofetil , daclizumab and anti-CD20 , are currently being tested in multicenter intervention trials."
17940453,"Summary : The inability to cure type 1 diabetes underscores the complex pathophysiology of the disease , and our poor knowledge of the precise etiological triggers and immunological mechanisms which culminate in the disease."
17940453,"While ongoing efforts to test individual agents with potential to ameliorate diabetes are needed , combination therapies employing multiple safe agents are likely to be the future of type 1 diabetes intervention studies."
19700362,"Adolescents with diabetes are at increased risk of developing psychiatric ( 10 - 20 % ) or eating disorders ( 8 - 30 % ) , as well as substance abuse ( 25 - 50 % ) , leading to non-compliance with treatment and deterioration of diabetic control."
19700362,At high risk are female adolescents with family problems and other comorbid disorders.
19700362,"Impaired cognitive function has also been reported among children with diabetes , mainly in boys , and especially in those with early diabetes diagnosis ( < 5 years ) , or with episodes of severe hypoglycaemia or prolonged hyperglycaemia."
19700362,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus contributes to the development of problems in parent - child relationships and employment difficulties , and negatively affects the quality of life."
19700362,"However , insulin pumps appear to improve patients ' metabolic control and lifestyle."
19700362,The contributions of family and friends to the quality of metabolic control and emotional support are also crucial.
19700362,"In addition , the role of the primary - care provider is important in identifying patients at high risk of developing psychosocial disorders and referring them on to health specialists."
19700362,"At high risk are patients in mid-adolescence with comorbid disorders , low socioeconomic status or parental health problems."
19700362,"Multisystem therapy , involving the medical team , school personnel , family and peer group , is also essential."
19700362,"The present review focuses on the prevalence of nutritional and psychosocial problems among adolescents with diabetes , and the risk factors for its development , and emphasizes specific goals in their management and prevention."
15813600,Contemporary outcome measures of chronic illnesses such as type 1 diabetes mellitus are broader than those clinical outcomes traditionally assessed in therapeutic encounters.
15813600,A holistic approach emphasises quality of life and emotional well - being as well as the achievement of optimal disease management.
15813600,"This paper reviews current knowledge about growth , metabolic control , diabetes complications , neurocognitive and psychological outcomes as well as health - related quality of life in childhood diabetes mellitus."
15813600,It is suggested that the antecedents of adverse diabetes and psychological outcomes in adolescence lie in the years prior to adolescence.
15813600,The model of care in childhood diabetes mellitus must be focussed on earlier screening and intervention if adverse outcomes are to be reduced.
12880184,One of the main difficulties in managing type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) in the young is nutritional treatment.
12880184,Studies have shown that adolescents ( particularly adolescent girls and young women ) have an increased risk for clinical and sub-clinical eating disorders.
12880184,"Adjustment to the nutritional regimen and , consequently , to the management of the disease in adolescence seems to involve a complex interplay of various psychosocial and biological aspects."
12880184,The aim of this review is to consider the relationship between T1DM and eating disorders in adolescence in the light of some important biological psychological and familial factors.
12880184,Further research is required in order to detect the degree of the interactions between these factors in adolescents with T1DM.
32037600,"McCune - Albright syndrome ( MAS ) is caused by postzygotic somatic activating mutations of GNAS and is classically characterized by the clinical triad of peripheral precocious puberty , café - au - lait pigmentation , and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia."
32037600,"It can also present with other hyperfunctioning endocrinopathies , including growth hormone excess , hyperprolactinemia , hypercortisolemia , hyperthyroidism , and renal phosphate wasting due to excess fibroblast growth factor 23."
32037600,"We review the clinical , biochemical , radiological , and genetic findings in a 7 - year - old girl diagnosed with MAS at age 4 and then with autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus at age 7."
32037600,"While MAS is associated with hyperglycemia secondary to growth hormone excess and hypercortisolemia , an association with diabetes mellitus has not been demonstrated."
32037600,We review the unique presentation of a patient with these two rare conditions.
32198703,"Purpose of review : Due to treatment advancements , individuals with type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) are living longer , presenting a unique understudied population with advanced complex needs."
32198703,This article is a review of the aging literature in T1D and identifies existing gaps while serving as a call to the research community.
32198703,"Recent findings : Recent studies have identified an association between cognitive impairment and glycemic variability , as well as increased risk and frequency of hypoglycemia in older adults with T1D."
32198703,"However , limited research exists about additional physical and mental health conditions and barrier to successful treatment in this population."
32198703,Older adults may experience both age - and diabetes - related barriers to diabetes management.
32198703,"Due to the scarcity of aging T1D research , current treatment guidelines for this age group are based on type 2 diabetes research."
32198703,There is a critical need to further investigate the physical and mental effects of T1D and aging as well as public health policy ; insurance challenges ; and needs for support and interventions for older adults with T1D.
31145129,Purpose of review : Evidence is mounting that disturbances in the gut microbiota play a role in the rising incidence of type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) and new technologies are expanding our ability to understand microbial function and host interactions.
31145129,Longitudinal data from large cohorts of children at risk of T1D are nor solidifying our understanding of the function of the microbiota in this disease.
31145129,"Recent findings : Although taxonomic changes in the gut microbiota associated with T1D are relatively modest , a functional defect in production of short - chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) remains as a unifying feature across multiple studies and populations."
31145129,Dysbiosis of the microbiota in T1D has been linked to decreased gut barrier and exocrine pancreas function.
31145129,"We explore factors contributing to the disturbed microbiota in T1D such as infant diet , probiotic use and genetic risk linked to defective immune regulation."
31145129,"We also discuss the interplay between immunotherapy , the gut immune response and the microbiota."
31145129,Summary : Functional alterations in the microbiota are linked to pathogenesis of T1D and these findings provide a rationale for future investigations aimed at establishing a healthy microbiota and promoting SCFA production and prevention of T1D.
26659804,"Type 1 diabetes , resulting from the autoimmune destruction of insulin producing islet beta cells is caused by genetic and environmental determinants."
26659804,"Recent studies agree that counterintuitively , the major genetic susceptibility factors are decreasing in frequency as the incidence of the condition increases."
26659804,This suggests a growing role for environmental determinants but these have been difficult to identify and our understanding of gene / environment effects are limited.
26659804,"Individuals "" at risk "" can be identified accurately through the presence of multiple islet autoantibodies and current efforts in type 1 diabetes research focus on improved biomarkers and strategies to prevent or reverse the condition through immunotherapy."
22825586,Invariant natural killer T ( iNKT ) cells are CD1d - restricted T cells with regulatory functions.
22825586,iNKT cells are numerically and functionally deficient in experimental models of type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ).
22825586,"Moreover , various experimental strategies correcting the defect of or stimulating iNKT cells prevent T1DM."
22825586,"Here , we review the data on the role of iNKT cells in the development of T1DM and discuss indications , obstacles and prospects of the use of iNKT cell manipulations in the prevention and treatment of human T1DM."
28789815,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic autoimmune disease that results from the destruction of beta ( β ) cells in the pancreatic islets , leading to loss of insulin production and resultant hyperglycemia."
28789815,Recent developments in stem cell biology have generated much excitement for β - cell replacement strategies ; β cells are one of many cell types in the complex islet environment and pancreas.
28789815,"In this Opinion , we discuss recent successful attempts to generate β cells and how this can be coupled with bioprinting technologies in order to fabricate pancreas tissues , which holds great potential for type 1 diabetes."
28789815,"Possibilities of integrating vascularization and encapsulation in bioprinted tissues are expounded , and future prospects , such as pancreas - on - a-chip , are also presented."
28552218,"Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is an irreversible degenerative disease with severe complications such as heart disease , nephropathy , neuropathy , and retinopathy."
28552218,"Although exogenous insulin administration is a life - saving therapy , it does not cure the disease."
28552218,This review addresses the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for the development of T1D and discusses epigenetic - based strategies for prevention and treatment of the disease.
28552218,We describe novel epigenetic biomarkers for the identification of susceptible individuals and the establishment of innovative therapies with epidrugs and cell therapy to regenerate the lost β - cells.
28552218,"Despite the wealth of promising data regarding the potential benefits of epigenetic tools to reduce the burden of T1D , clinical trials are still very few , and this issue needs to be resolved in the near future."
10436248,"Although the causes of eating disorders remain unclear , epidemiological evidence suggests that peripubertal changes in body shape and weight predispose young women to develop unhealthy eating attitudes."
10436248,A psychiatric diagnosis of an eating disorder can be made in up to 10 % of young women with insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( type 1 diabetes ).
10436248,"Eating disorders , anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa , pose a particularly serious risk to health in young diabetic people."
10436248,"Several features associated with type 1 diabetes and its treatment , such as weight gain , dietary restraint and food preoccupation , may predispose young diabetic women to develop a clinical or subclinical eating disorder."
10436248,The coexistence of these conditions could lead to poor metabolic control and an increased risk of microvascular complications.
11272129,"The etiological heterogeneity of idiopathic diabetes has been recognized for 25 years , and subdivision into type 1 and type 2 diabetes is fundamental to the way we think about the disease."
11272129,Review of the literature suggests that the concept of type 1 diabetes as an immunemediated disease emerged rapidly over the period from 1974 to 1976 and showed many of the features of a classic paradigm shift.
11272129,"A few key observations triggered recognition and acceptance of the new paradigm , but the necessary context was provided by scientific developments in areas mainly unrelated to diabetes."
11272129,"The disease paradigm established by 1976 is still widely accepted , and its essential features have been modified only in detail by the revolution in molecular biology that has occurred over the intervening period."
11272129,"Notwithstanding , some of the underlying assumptions remain imprecise , unchallenged , or unconfirmed."
11272129,Appreciation of the historical origin and subsequent evolution of these fundamental concepts could stimulate critical analysis and help prepare the way for a new paradigm.
29407057,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus , an autoimmune disorder characterized by beta - cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency , is associated with significantly increased cardiovascular disease risk but the mechanisms underlying this enhanced risk are unclear."
29407057,"Results of the pivotal Diabetes Control and Complications Trial / Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study have shown that compared to conventional therapy , intensive glycemic control results in decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
29407057,"Evidence from this study also revealed contributions of blood pressure , renal disease , body weight , and lipids to cardiovascular disease in type 1 diabetes mellitus."
29407057,"Extrapolating from existing evidence , this article addresses clinical strategies to mitigate cardiovascular risks."
26370697,Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) affects 1.93 in 1000 youth in the USA.
26370697,"Over the last 40 years , a combination of genetic and immunological markers has been developed allowing for the accurate prediction of progression to T1D."
26370697,"Despite our abilities to predict disease and the marked improvement in our understanding of the natural history of T1D , therapies capable of preventing or reversing T1D remain elusive."
26370697,This article will review recent and ongoing efforts to understand the causes of T1D and related efforts to study potential therapies aimed at preventing T1D.
17176121,"Between ten and twenty million people worldwide have type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) , which has previously been called juvenile diabetes , childhood diabetes , and insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus."
17176121,T1DM is undoubtedly a multifactorial disease affecting predisposed individuals with genetic susceptibilities ; it is also associated with environmental factors leading to unbalanced immune responses.
17176121,This chronic disorder is caused by auto - aggressive T lymphocytes entering the pancreatic islets of Langerhans where they destroy the insulin - producing beta - cells.
17176121,A wide variety of immuno - interventions cure T1DM effectively in different animal models when given early in disease development.
17176121,"However , few of these interventions are efficacious in humans at a later stage of the disease."
17176121,"Indeed , only three immunotherapeutic compounds have demonstrated both safety and efficacy in phase II / III clinical trials."
17176121,"Although much time and resources have been spent on generating potent immune therapies , none of the patients enrolled in these trials have achieved normoglycemia in the absence of insulin injections."
17176121,Many reasons can account for such a disappointing conclusion.
17176121,"Firstly , the dynamics of disease pathogenesis differs significantly from patient to patient , which directly impacts the therapeutic efficacy."
17176121,"Also , at trial entry , the percentage of remaining pancreatic beta - cells in T1DM patients often reflects the odds of responding positively to treatment."
17176121,"Based on the knowledge we have gained from preclinical studies and clinical trials , several steps have been made in the development of safer and more efficient immune - based therapies."
17176121,"There are , however , a number of concerns that should be addressed in order to improve future therapeutic strategies."
11711327,The purpose of this article is to review the available pathophysiological and clinical studies of patients with idiopathic Type 1 diabetes.
11711327,Idiopathic Type 1 diabetes is a common form of diabetes most commonly seen in obese African American individuals living in large urban areas.
11711327,This type of diabetes usually presents with the typical signs and symptoms of Type 1 diabetes such as diabetic ketoacidosis but its subsequent clinical course often resembles Type 2 diabetes.
11711327,The natural history and pathogenesis of idiopathic Type 1 diabetes is unknown because most of these studies on these patients were done shortly after diagnosis.
11711327,"For the most part , these patients have been treated as if they had Type 2 diabetes with diet and / or oral agents but recent studies suggest that patients have a very variable response to diet and oral agents."
11711327,They seem to have better long - term glycemic control with the use of insulin therapy.
11711327,"Although the pathogenesis of this disease is unknown , it may be related to lipotoxicity , glucose toxicity or transcription factors involved in fuel metabolism."
11437693,Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic T cell - mediated disease resulting from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta - cells.
11437693,This process leads to progressive and irreversible failure of insulin secretion.
11437693,Development of the disease involves both genetic and environmental factors.
11437693,"Genetic predisposition is mainly connected with the human leucocyte antigen ( HLA ) region , which encodes structures responsible for antigen presentation."
11437693,A comprehensive molecular understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is essential for the design of rational and well tolerated means of prevention.
11437693,This paper describes recent experimental and clinical findings and elucidates the current possibilities for immunotherapy of type 1 diabetes.
11437693,The nature of breakdown of self - tolerance and the mechanisms involved in its recovery are discussed.
20723816,"This article reviews economic methodologies developed for estimating cost of illness , examines the current literature on diabetes costs , and presents the latest estimates of the economic impact of type 1 diabetes in terms of direct medical costs ( ie , treatment costs ) and indirect costs ( eg , lost wages )."
15794911,Predicting type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is a prerequisite for disease prevention.
15794911,"Prediction is currently performed on three levels , which include the genetic susceptibility for disease , the identification of preclinical T1DM by way of circulating islet autoantibodies , and the use of metabolic tests to stage preclinical disease into late or early prediabetes."
15794911,"Combinations of genetic markers such as HLA genotype , INS genotype , and if and how much family history of T1DM is present can stratify disease risk more than 1000-fold , and can be used for selection of first - degree relatives of patients with T1DM for primary intervention trials."
15794911,Measurement of autoantibodies in genetically at - risk subjects identifies future cases of T1DM.
15794911,Further stratification of diabetes risk in autoantibody - positive subjects can be made on the basis of autoantibody characteristics that correspond to the magnitude of the autoantibody response.
28712629,Background : Recent publications describing long - term follow - up from landmark trials and diabetes registries represent an opportunity to revisit modeling options in type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ).
28712629,Objectives : To develop a new product - independent model capable of predicting long - term clinical and cost outcomes.
28712629,"Methods : After a systematic literature review to identify clinical trial and registry data , a model was developed ( the PRIME Diabetes Model ) to simulate T1DM progression and complication onset."
28712629,"The model runs as a patient - level simulation , making use of covariance matrices for cohort generation and risk factor progression , and simulating myocardial infarction , stroke , angina , heart failure , nephropathy , retinopathy , macular edema , neuropathy , amputation , hypoglycemia , ketoacidosis , mortality , and risk factor evolution."
28712629,"Several approaches novel to T1DM modeling were used , including patient characteristics and risk factor covariance , a glycated hemoglobin progression model derived from patient - level data , and model averaging approaches to evaluate complication risk."
28712629,Results : Validation analyses comparing modeled outcomes with published studies demonstrated that the PRIME Diabetes Model projects long - term patient outcomes consistent with those reported for a number of long - term studies.
28712629,Macrovascular end points were reliably reproduced across five different populations and microvascular complication risk was accurately predicted on the basis of comparisons with landmark studies and published registry data.
28712629,"Conclusions : The PRIME Diabetes Model is product - independent , available online , and has been developed in line with good practice guidelines."
28712629,Validation has indicated that outcomes from long - term studies can be reliably reproduced.
28712629,The model offers new approaches to long - standing challenges in diabetes modeling and may become a valuable tool for informing health care policy.
22481729,Friends ' support is a key element in the management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.
22481729,This study describes the influence of friends on the lives of children with Diabetes Mellitus and its implications for managing the disease.
22481729,"Empirical data were collected through semi-structured interviews , supported with the use of puppets , with 19 children aged between seven and 12 years old."
22481729,"The qualitative analysis of the testimonies allowed understanding the phenomenon from two perspectives : the attitude of friends towards the child , positively or negatively affecting the disease 's management , and the attitude of the child toward friends."
22481729,The knowledge of those involved and the interaction between the children with DM1 and their friends impacts the management of the disease.
22481729,Understanding the implications of these interactions contributes to the delivery of qualified nursing care to this population.
27959859,"Type 1 diabetes , a disease defined by absolute insulin deficiency , is considered a chronic autoimmune disorder resulting from the destruction of insulin - producing pancreatic β - cells."
27959859,The incidence of childhood - onset type 1 diabetes has been increasing at a rate of 3 % - 5 % per year globally.
27959859,"Despite the introduction of an impressive array of therapies aimed at improving disease management , no means for a practical "" cure "" exist."
27959859,"This said , hope remains high that any of a number of emerging technologies ( e.g. , continuous glucose monitoring , insulin pumps , smart algorithms ) , alongside advances in stem cell biology , cell encapsulation methodologies , and immunotherapy , will eventually impact the lives of those with recently diagnosed or established type 1 diabetes."
27959859,"However , efforts aimed at reversing insulin dependence do not address the obvious benefits of disease prevention."
27959859,"Hence , key "" stretch goals "" for type 1 diabetes research include identifying improved and increasingly practical means for diagnosing the disease at earlier stages in its natural history ( i.e. , early , presymptomatic diagnosis ) , undertaking such efforts in the population at large to optimally identify those with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes , and introducing safe and effective therapeutic options for prevention."
24628439,Aim : To identify the role of the nurse practitioner in caring for female adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus at risk for disordered eating behaviour and to formulate clinical recommendations for nurse practitioners in the primary care setting.
24628439,Background : Transition into adulthood can be difficult for female adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
24628439,Challenges associated with management of this illness may place adolescent females at an increased risk for disordered eating.
24628439,Design : Discussion paper.
24628439,"Data sources : Sourced literature from 1991 - 2013 , located through CINAHL , Health Source , Proquest , PubMed , PsychInfo , Web of Science and Medline databases."
24628439,Implications for nursing : Nurses involved in the primary care of female adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus need to be aware of the increased risk for disordered eating behaviours and develop the competencies to care for both the adolescent and her family to reduce the serious consequences of these behaviours.
24628439,"Conclusion : Awareness and acquisition of the skills required to intervene will enable nurse practitioners to recognize clients at risk for disordered eating , gain appreciation of the motivation of female adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus towards disordered eating behaviours and give optimal opportunity for education , counselling and recovery."
24628439,"Future direction for research includes exploration of the experiences of adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus ; early interventions in the primary care setting ; effective educational , preventative or supportive services for adolescents with this illness and their families ; and outcomes to emerging technologies for insulin therapy on disordered eating occurrence."
28647944,A significant increase in children < 6 years of age being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is occurring.
28647944,The parents ( caregivers ) of these children have full responsibility for the complex and individualized management while having to deal with the emotional stress of caring for a child with a chronic condition.
28647944,This article will provide a summary of the diagnosis and recommended medical treatment for this special age group of children.
28647944,Also presented will be common day - to - day family management issues for health care providers to consider as they provide care for this most common endocrine chronic condition.
21068340,"Background : Diabetes mellitus has been historically divided into type 1 and type 2 diabetes , with type 1 being an autoimmune disease and type 2 being primarily a metabolic disease."
21068340,Content : The current diabetes classification scheme needs to be reevaluated because of the accumulating evidence of immune system involvement in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.
21068340,"Summary : There are similarities and differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes with regard to pathogenesis , pathophysiology , and genetics."
21068340,We propose a resolution to the dilemma of the current classification scheme.
26454449,Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is the most common autoimmune disease in pediatrics with a prevalence of roughly 1 in 500 children in the USA.
26454449,Genome - wide association studies have identified more than 50 variants associated with increased risk for type 1 diabetes.
26454449,"Comparison of these variants with those identified in other autoimmune diseases reveals three important findings : ( 1 ) there is a high degree of overlap in implicated variants in diseases with similar pathophysiology , ( 2 ) in diseases with differing pathophysiology the same variants are often implicated in opposite roles , ( 3 ) in diseases with differing pathophysiology that have many non-overlapping or oppositely implicated variants there are still several variants which are overlapping or shared."
26454449,"Thus , the genetic overlap between T1DM and other autoimmune diseases forms the basis for our understanding of druggable targets in type 1 diabetes."
30912245,Objective : To evaluate the association between socioeconomic status ( SES ) and diabetes outcomes in German children and adolescents.
30912245,Methods : A total of 1829 subjects < 18 years old with type 1 diabetes mellitus from 13 German diabetes centers were included from June 2013 until June 2014.
30912245,Data were collected within the multicenter DPV ( Diabetes Prospective Follow - up ) registry.
30912245,SES was measured with a composite index.
30912245,"Multivariable regression models were applied to analyze the association of SES and outcomes adjusted for age , sex , diabetes duration , and migration status."
30912245,"Results : Low SES was significantly associated with worse diabetes outcomes : higher hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1c ) ( 64.3 mmol / mol ) , lower proportion of insulin pump therapy ( 43.6 % ) , fewer daily self - monitored blood glucose ( SMBG ) measurements ( 5.7 ) , more inpatient days per patient - year ( 5.8 ) compared to patients with medium / high SES ( HbA1c : 61.3 mmol / mol , P < 0.001 / 59.8 mmol / mol , P < 0.0001 ; proportion of pump therapy : 54.5 % , P < 0.01 / 54.9 % , P < 0.01 ; SMBG : 6.0 , P < 0.01 / 6.1 , P < 0.01 ; inpatient days : 4.5 , P < 0.0001 / 3.4 , P < 0.0001 )."
30912245,The inclusion of migration status in the models resulted in only minor changes in the outcomes.
30912245,"Conclusion : Despite free health care , low SES is associated with unfavorable diabetes outcomes in Germany."
30912245,The poorer diabetes outcomes of children with diabetes have been attributed to their migration status and may be partly explained by low SES.
30912245,Both factors must become part of targeted diabetes care in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
21981959,Prevention of loss of b cells in type 1 diabetes is a major goal of current research.
21981959,"Knowledge of the genetic susceptibility , increasing ability to predict who may be at risk , recognition of the potential clinical impact of residual insulin secretion after diagnosis , and development of new immunomodulatory agents have supported an increasing number of clinical trials to prevent b - cell loss."
21981959,"Interventions can be targeted at 3 stages : before the development of autoimmunity ( primary prevention ) , after autoimmunity is recognized ( secondary prevention ) , or after diagnosis when significant numbers of b cells remain ( tertiary prevention )."
21981959,"Thus far , several agents show promise when given shortly after diagnosis , but no interventions before diagnosis have shown benefit."
21981959,Knowledge in this area has grown quickly in recent years and will continue to grow rapidly with several international collaborative efforts underway.
17616634,Context : Type 1 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by severe beta - cell loss.
17616634,The great majority of patients have type 1A or immune - mediated diabetes.
17616634,"Synthesis : There has been recent progress in defining the genetics , pathogenesis , and natural history of the disease."
17616634,"In addition , there is a major effort to develop immunotherapies to prevent the disorder and to cure the disease with islet transplantation , and there is potential for dramatic improvement in care with introduction of continuous glucose monitoring devices."
17616634,"The discovery of "" metabolic memory "" underscores the importance of excellent metabolic control."
17616634,"With comprehensive care , major microvascular complications ( e.g. blindness and renal failure ) are preventable for most patients."
17616634,"Conclusion : The existence of multiple "" competing "" technologies to deal with this devastating disorder holds promise of improved outcomes."
16478821,"Context : The aim of this review was to explore the pathogenic and clinical spectrum of type 1 diabetes , which includes a form of adult onset autoimmune diabetes usually referred to as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults ( LADA )."
16478821,"We looked at this entire range of forms of autoimmune diabetes as a spectrum of genetic and nongenetic environmental influences , diabetes - associated immune responses , and metabolic changes."
16478821,"Evidence acquisition : We assessed epidemiological , genetic , immunological , and clinical data from major articles on autoimmune diabetes , including LADA and type 1 diabetes , published since 1992."
16478821,Evidence synthesis : Data analysis of autoimmune diabetes indi - cates that type 1 diabetes and LADA occupy different poles of the same spectrum.
16478821,Conclusion : Evidence is presented that LADA represents one end of a rainbow encompassing type 1 diabetes.
16478821,The clinical nature and management of autoimmune diabetes poses important therapeutic questions regarding conventional therapy for hyperglycemia as well as therapy aiming to protect residual beta - cell function.
16478821,"Limiting loss of endogenous insulin secretion using immunomodulation could be valuable , not only for LADA but also for type 1 diabetes."
32475523,"Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is an autoimmune disease caused by complex interactions between host genetics and environmental factors , culminating in the T - cell mediated destruction of the insulin producing cells in the pancreas."
32475523,The rapid increase in disease frequency over the past 50 years or more has been too rapid to attribute to genetics.
32475523,Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is currently being widely investigated as a major contributor to environmental change driving increased T1D onset.
32475523,"In this chapter , we discuss the major changes in gut microbiota composition and function linked to T1D risk as well as the potential origin of these changes including infant diet , antibiotic use and host genetics."
32475523,We examine the interaction between inflammation and gut barrier function and the dysbiotic gut microbiota that have been linked to T1D.
16611168,Autoimmune type 1 diabetes is strongly associated with a number of immune abnormalities that manifest themselves before and at the time of clinical diagnosis.
16611168,The clinical onset is associated with a major loss of the pancreatic islet beta cells.
16611168,Insulin treatment is the only treatment option since numerous trials with agents that suppress or modulate immune function have failed to preserve beta cell function long term.
16611168,Recent studies suggest that it is possible to predict clinical onset of diabetes by combining genetic with autoantibody testing.
16611168,In this review we will summarize current and future drug targets for subjects at risk for type 1 diabetes as well as for subjects with recent onset disease.
16611168,We will also discuss the possible importance of initiating as well as contributing factors such as reactive oxygen species and modified autoantigens.
16611168,It is speculated that drug targets of factors important to disease pathogenesis may provide safe and effective adductive treatment to preserve beta cell function in autoantibody positive subjects who are at maximum risk for disease.
19496963,Children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) are at risk for a variety of problems at school.
19496963,"Well - controlled studies using data collected in schools , however , are limited."
19496963,The purposes of this study are to determine whether selected school problems are associated with T1DM and to investigate an association between these problems and medical variables.
19496963,"Teachers rated 95 diabetic students ( M = 11.8 ; SD = 3.0 yr old ) and 95 of their siblings ( M = 12.1 ; SD = 3.0 yr old ) regarding academic skills , work completion , day - to - day variability , and classroom attention."
19496963,Medical and school records also were accessed.
19496963,"The T1DM group had lower academic skills ratings overall ( p < 0.02 ) , especially in writing ( p < 0.01 ) , a trend toward poorer classroom attention ( p < 0.08 ) , and many more missed school days ( p < 0.001 )."
19496963,"Diabetics on intensive therapy protocols had better academic ratings overall ( p < 0.02 ) , including in math ( p < 0.03 ) and fewer missed school days ( p < 0.03 ) , but they unexpectedly were rated as having more classroom behaviors that jeopardize work completion ( p < 0.05 ) than counterparts on conventional therapy."
19496963,"Among all diabetics , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA ( lc ) ) levels were moderately related to each academic skill rating ( r = -0.34 to -0.37 ; p < 0.01 ) and strongly related to classroom attention ( r = 0.53 ; p = 0.000 )."
19496963,T1DM itself appears to be a relatively minor influence to several important aspects of school.
19496963,"Furthermore , although intensive therapy alone may well promote school success , meticulous glycemic control , however achieved , appears more important in mitigating prospective classroom attention and academic problems."
31754811,Purpose of review : The protection against CVD observed in women compared to men in the general population is essentially erased in type 1 diabetes.
31754811,"This review will discuss evidence regarding the role of glucose management on CVD risk by sex , with a particular focus on studies of long - duration type 1 diabetes of > 20 years."
31754811,"Recent findings : Across studies , women with type 1 diabetes have similar or worse glycemic control compared to men , despite higher rates of intensive insulin therapy."
31754811,"The association between HbA1c and CVD risk does not seem to differ by sex , but few studies have reported on sex - specific analyses."
31754811,"Beyond HbA1c , there is a lack of published data regarding the relationship between other aspects of glucose management and CVD risk by sex in type 1 diabetes."
31754811,"Glucose management factors do not seem to directly account for the increased CVD risk in women with type 1 diabetes , but may influence other risk factors that play a more direct role."
19944292,Prevention of loss of beta cells in type 1 diabetes is a major goal of current research.
19944292,"Knowledge of the genetic susceptibility , increasing ability to predict who may be at risk , recognition of the potential clinical impact of residual insulin secretion after diagnosis , and development of new immunomodulatory agents have supported an increasing number of clinical trials to prevent beta - cell loss."
19944292,"Interventions can be targeted at 3 stages : before the development of autoimmunity ( primary prevention ) , after autoimmunity is recognized ( secondary prevention ) , or after diagnosis when significant numbers of beta cells remain ( tertiary prevention )."
19944292,"Thus far , several agents show promise when given shortly after diagnosis , but no interventions before diagnosis have shown benefit."
19944292,Knowledge in this area has grown quickly in recent years and will continue to grow rapidly with several international collaborative efforts underway.
18357774,The origins of type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) are largely unknown.
18357774,"Fewer than 50 % of the cases of the disease are attributable to host genetics , indicating that environmental factors are involved in disease development."
18357774,"The most often cited environmental agents implicated as initiators of T1D are the human enteroviruses , in particular the group B coxsackieviruses ( CVB )."
18357774,"Although the connection between the CVB and T1D has not been firmly established , significant ' evidence supports the role of these pathogens in T1D development."
17179928,Fulminant type 1 diabetes is a recently discovered subtype of type 1 diabetes.
17179928,It is defined as diabetes in which the process of beta - cell destruction and the progression of hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis are extremely rapid.
17179928,"The pathogenesis of this disease remains to be clarified , but the involvement of both genetic background - especially human leukocyte antigen genes - and viruses has been suggested."
17179928,"Fulminant type 1 diabetes has the following clinical characteristics : duration of hyperglycemic symptoms is 4 days on average ; there is a high prevalence of preceding common - cold - like and gastrointestinal symptoms ; there is a near - normal level of glycated hemoglobin in spite of very high plasma glucose levels associated with ketoacidosis ; the disease is sometimes related to pregnancy ; and there are increased serum pancreatic enzyme levels , absent C - peptide levels , but virtually no detectable autoantibodies against constituents of pancreatic beta cells."
17179928,The presence of the above characteristics strongly indicates the diagnosis of fulminant type 1 diabetes.
17179928,"Once the diagnosis of this disease is suspected , treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis must be started immediately , as in all other cases of type 1 diabetes."
17179928,"Otherwise , the death of the patient is likely to occur within 24 h. All medical practitioners must remember that this extremely rapidly progressing type of diabetes does exist , and they must pay special attention not to overlook it."
25529223,"Over the 50 years from 1964 to 2014 , outcomes for children with type 1 diabetes have improved significantly , because of both technological advancements and changes in management philosophy."
25529223,"For the child with type 1 diabetes in 2014 , intensive management with multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy and the support of a specialist multidisciplinary team is now standard care."
25529223,"The main treatment goal is no longer the avoidance of hypoglycaemia , but the minimisation of hyperglycaemia and glucose variability , thereby reducing the risk of microvascular complications."
25529223,"However , the inherent burden of care and diligence required by patients and families , if they are to maintain optimal diabetes control , have not changed and may even have increased."
25529223,"While the long sought - after cure for diabetes remains elusive , artificial pancreas or closed - loop systems hold the most promise for improving the burden of care in the near term for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes."
20920447,"Sardinia and Finland are the "" hottest "" areas for type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) worldwide."
20920447,"Its genetic and epidemiological background make Sardinia an ideal region for investigating environmental , immunological , and genetic factors related to the etiopathogenesis of T1DM."
20920447,"Consequently , in 1990 , the Insulin - Dependent Diabetes Mellitus Sardinia Project was launched in order to map the geographical distribution of T1DM in the island and to investigate preclinical phases of T1DM in a large cohort of people genetically at risk."
20920447,"The final goal would be to design models of prediction and to formulate safe preventive measures , especially addressed to the general population living in areas at high risk."
20377666,Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is characterised by immune - mediated pancreatic islet beta - cell destruction.
20377666,"The initial immune response engenders secondary and tertiary responses which collectively result in impairment of beta - cell function , progressive destruction of beta - cells and consequent development of T1D."
20377666,"The process is insidious and may evolve over many years , with the overt expression of clinical symptoms becoming apparent only when most beta - cells have been destroyed."
20377666,"Over the last quarter century much investigation has been directed at interdicting the T1D disease process , both during the stage of evolution of the disease and at the time of disease onset."
20377666,This chapter of the Yearbook of Advanced Technology and Treatments in Diabetes reviews the key articles that have appeared in this field between January 2008 and June 2009.
17180706,Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is a common chronic disease of childhood.
17180706,Patients with T1D are at significant risk for developing serious health complications.
17180706,"Understanding of the genetics , environmental factors , and natural history of diabetes has lead to greater understanding of the etiology and epidemiology of T1D."
17180706,"Furthermore , technology has greatly improved glycemic control and reduction of complications."
17180706,"However , prevention of the development of diabetes remains elusive."
17180706,"This review article describes the past , current and upcoming strategies for diabetes prevention for patients at risk for developing autoimmunity , after antibody production , and patients with new onset diabetes."
24424179,Diabetes mellitus is increasing in prevalence worldwide.
24424179,The economic costs and burden of the disease are considerable given the cardiovascular complications and co-morbidities that it may entail.
24424179,"Two major groups of diabetes mellitus have been defined , type 1 , or immune - based , and type 2."
24424179,"In recent years , other subgroups have been described in - between these major groups."
24424179,"Correct classification of the disease is crucial in order to ascribe the most efficient preventive , diagnostic and treatment strategies for each patient."
24424179,"In the present review , we discuss the epidemiology , etiopathogenesis , diagnostic criteria and clinical classification of what is currently known as autoimmune diabetes."
24424179,"In addition , the other groups of diabetes mellitus will be regarded in relation to their pathogenesis and potential autoimmunity features."
25330352,Research on treatment for diabetes and co-occurring eating disorders is sparse.
25330352,We examined outcomes from multidisciplinary residential treatment for women with type 1 diabetes and eating disorders and the impact of treatment duration on outcomes.
25330352,Participants were 29 women with type 1 diabetes and eating disorders receiving residential treatment.
25330352,Repeated measures analyses of variance examined changes in blood glucose and psychological symptoms over treatment.
25330352,Analyses were repeated to include treatment by duration interactions.
25330352,"Treatment produced significant reductions in blood glucose , eating disorder symptoms , and psychological concerns."
25330352,Longer treatment duration was associated with greater improvements in psychological symptoms.
23949580,Aims / hypothesis : The aim of this study was to estimate absolute and relative mortality rates in patients with type 1 diabetes at the Steno Diabetes Centre relative to the general Danish background population.
23949580,"Methods : Patients with type 1 diabetes ( n = 4,821 ) were followed from 1 January 2002 until 1 January 2011 , with death from any cause as the main outcome."
23949580,"Poisson regression was used to model mortality rates by age , diabetes duration and calendar time , according to sex."
23949580,"Results : In the period 2002 - 2010 , a total of 673 deaths ( 402 men , 271 women ) occurred in the study population during 33,847 years of follow - up of type 1 diabetes."
23949580,The predominant cause of death in patients with type 1 diabetes was cardiovascular disease.
23949580,"Mortality rates were highest among those with the lowest age at onset , particularly men."
23949580,"The mortality rate in the diabetic population decreased over that time period by 6.6 % and 4.8 % per year in men and women , respectively ; this was substantially greater than the decrease in mortality rates in the background population."
23949580,The decline in standard mortality rate was 4.3 % per year in men and 2.6 % per year in women.
23949580,Patients who did not develop nephropathy had only slightly elevated mortality rates compared with the background population.
23949580,"Conclusions / interpretation : Despite advances in care , mortality rates in the past decade continue to be greater in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those without diabetes ; however , the mortality rate in patients decreased over the study period faster than that of the background population."
23949580,Nephropathy seems to be the main driver of the excess mortality.
21218503,The incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing and this may double the burden of disease in our youngest by 2020.
21218503,The recent increase in incidence is mostly happening in the very young and those with moderate genetic susceptibility.
21218503,"Many environmental factors have been implicated , but no major determinants have been clearly identified , and the mechanisms of involvement remain elusive."
21218503,"This review summarizes current research efforts directed at understanding the possible reasons for this increase , including the role of viruses , gut microbiota , early life feeding patterns , perinatal factors and childhood growth patterns."
21218503,It also provides a road map for future research directions.
19114721,"We will take a journey from basic pathogenetic mechanisms elicited by viral infections that play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes to clinical interventions , where we will discuss novel combination therapies."
19114721,The role of viral infections in the development of type 1 diabetes is a rather interesting topic because in experimental models viruses appear capable of both accelerating as well as decelerating the immunological processes leading to type 1 diabetes.
19114721,"Consequently , I will discuss some of the underlying mechanisms for each situation and consider methods to investigate the proposed dichotomy for the involvement of viruses in human type 1 diabetes."
19114721,"Prevention of type 1 diabetes by infection supports the so - called "" hygiene hypothesis ."""
19114721,"Interestingly , viruses invoke mechanisms that need to be exploited by novel combinatorial immune - based interventions , the first one being the elimination of autoaggressive T - cells attacking the beta - cells , ultimately leading to their immediate but temporally limited amelioration."
19114721,"The other is the invigoration of regulatory T - cells ( Tregs ) , which can mediate long - term tolerance to beta - cell proteins in the pancreatic islets and draining lymph nodes."
19114721,"In combination , these two immune elements have the potential to permanently stop type 1 diabetes."
19114721,It is my belief that only combination therapies will enable the permanent prevention and curing of type 1 diabetes.
31010879,"Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is an autoimmune disease that is caused , in part , by T cell - mediated destruction of insulin - producing β - cells."
31010879,"High risk for disease , in those with genetic susceptibility , is predicted by the presence of two or more autoantibodies against insulin , the 65 - kDa form of glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD65 ) , insulinoma - associated protein 2 ( IA - 2 ) , and zinc transporter 8 ( ZnT8 )."
31010879,"Despite this knowledge , we still do not know what leads to the breakdown of tolerance to these autoantigens , and we have an incomplete understanding of T1D etiology and pathophysiology."
31010879,"Several new autoantibodies have recently been discovered using innovative technologies , but neither their potential utility in monitoring disease development and treatment nor their role in the pathophysiology and etiology of T1D has been explored."
31010879,"Moreover , neoantigen generation ( through posttranslational modification , the formation of hybrid peptides containing two distinct regions of an antigen or antigens , alternative open reading frame usage , and translation of RNA splicing variants ) has been reported , and autoreactive T cells that target these neoantigens have been identified."
31010879,"Collectively , these new studies provide a conceptual framework to understand the breakdown of self - tolerance , if such modifications occur in a tissue - or disease - specific context."
31010879,A recent workshop sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases brought together investigators who are using new methods and technologies to identify autoantigens and characterize immune responses toward these proteins.
31010879,Researchers with diverse expertise shared ideas and identified resources to accelerate antigen discovery and the detection of autoimmune responses in T1D.
31010879,"The application of this knowledge will direct strategies for the identification of improved biomarkers for disease progression and treatment response monitoring and , ultimately , will form the foundation for novel antigen - specific therapeutics."
31010879,This Perspective highlights the key issues that were addressed at the workshop and identifies areas for future investigation.
20446034,"Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) was diagnosed in a 6 - year - old neutered male ferret with polyuria / polydipsia , symmetrical alopecia , and weight loss."
20446034,"Laboratory tests revealed severe hyperglycemia , glucosuria , and increased steroid hormone profile."
20446034,Abdominal ultrasound revealed a bilateral enlargement of the adrenal glands.
20446034,Significant clinical improvement was achieved with insulin - and leuprolide acetate - based therapy.
20446034,"After 2 months of therapy , the ferret showed a severe ketoacidosis , and the owner decided to euthanize the animal."
20446034,Histological findings revealed carcinoma of the left adrenal cortex and cortical hyperplasia of the right adrenal gland.
20446034,"Moderate , chronic , and active pancreatitis with a marked decrease in the number of beta - cells was also present."
20446034,This is the first reported case of type 1 DM associated with hyperadrenocorticism and chronic pancreatitis in a ferret.
9047087,Hypoglycaemia provokes unpleasant symptoms and sensations in patients with insulin - dependent ( Type 1 ) diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ).
9047087,"There is much interest in , and information on , the cognitive effects of acute insulin - induced hypoglycaemia."
9047087,"However , the effects of hypoglycaemia on brain function extend to important , non-cognitive aspects of psychological functioning , which are reviewed here."
9047087,"Acute hypoglycaemia induces changes in mood which result in a transient state of ' tense tiredness ' , a decrease in happiness , an increase in tense arousal , and decreased energetic arousal."
9047087,Appraisals of life problems are affected adversely.
9047087,"Frequent exposure to hypoglycaemia is associated with heightened fear of hypoglycaemia , which can be quantitated in individuals."
9047087,Personality may also influence behavioural responses to hypoglycaemia and the ability of an individual to cope with diabetes.
9047087,"The adverse effects of hypoglycaemia on mood , behaviour , personality , social function and management of diabetes in individual patients may be profound and need to be identified and addressed appropriately."
26843788,Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is an autoimmune disease which is characterized by progressive destruction of insulin producing pancreatic islet β cells.
26843788,The risk of developing T1D is determined by both genetic and environmental factors.
26843788,A growing body of evidence supports an important role of T helper type 17 ( Th17 ) cells along with impaired T regulatory ( Treg ) cells in the development of T1D in animal models and humans.
26843788,Alteration of gut microbiota has been implicated to be responsible for the imbalance between Th17 and Treg cells.
26843788,"However , there is controversy concerning a pathogenic versus protective role of Th17 cells in murine models of diabetes in the context of influence of gut microbiota."
26843788,In this review we will summarize current knowledge about Th17 cells and gut microbiota involved in T1D and propose Th17 targeted therapy in children with islet autoimmunity to prevent progression to overt diabetes.
26003192,No treatment to halt the progressive loss of insulin - producing beta - cells in type 1 diabetes mellitus has yet been clinically introduced.
26003192,Strategies tested have at best only transiently preserved beta - cell function and in many cases with obvious side effects of drugs used.
26003192,Several studies have suggested that mesenchymal stromal cells exert strong immunomodulatory properties with the capability to prevent or halt diabetes development in animal models of type 1 diabetes.
26003192,A multitude of mechanisms has been forwarded to exert this effect.
26003192,"Recently , we translated this strategy into a first clinical phase I / IIa trial and observed no side effects , and preserved or even increased C - peptide responses to a mixed meal tolerance test during the first year after treatment."
26003192,"Future blinded , larger studies , with extended follow - up , are clearly of interest to investigate this treatment concept."
11460579,Type 1 diabetes results from the destruction of the insulin - producing beta cells of the pancreas.
11460579,The disease process is thought to be initiated by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors leading to a cellular and humoral autoimmune response against beta cell specific components.
11460579,Over the past decade there has been important progress in identification of several diabetes specific autoantigens.
11460579,"The availability of recombinant antigens , most notably the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) and the tyrosine phosphatase - like molecule IA - 2 , made it possible to develop simple , sensitive and specific radioimmunoassays for the detection of autoantibodies on a large scale."
11460579,It has been shown that the combination of GAD antibodies ( GADA ) and IA - 2 antibodies ( IA -2-A ) with insulin autoantibodies ( IAA ) can replace the conventional ICA test.
11460579,This considerably facilitates screening programmes.
11460579,Prospective studies in subjects with and without family history of type 1 diabetes conclusively demonstrate that the risk for type 1 diabetes is strongly correlated with the number of positive antibodies.
11460579,The 5 -10-years risk for type 1 diabetes varies from 0 - 1 % in individuals with only one positive antibodies to 62 - 100 % in subjects who were positive for three or more antibodies.
11460579,"Despite the identification of novel genetic markers associated with type 1 diabetes , the major histocompatibility complex , namely HLA - DQ alleles , still represents the strongest genetic risk factor."
11460579,The analysis of HLA - DQ alleles may be important to discriminate between subjects at high or intermediate risk from antibody positive individuals carrying protective haplotypes.
11460579,Assessment of the metabolic state using the first phase insulin response to intravenous glucose may provide additional information to predict rapid progression to diabetes.
11460579,Screening for multiple antibodies is the most specific and sensitive strategy for identifying subject at risk for type 1 diabetes.
11460579,Second - line genotyping or analysis of the first phase insulin response can serve as useful tool to improve the prediction of type 1 diabetes.
11460579,The value of additional markers such as isotype specific autoantibodies or T - helper cells subsets measured by ELISPOT assays or FACS remains to be shown.
18446141,"Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus has completely changed our view of this disease in the past 25 years - from an acute , fulminant disease , to a chronic , autoimmune process."
18446141,Information on genetic and serologic markers has increased our ability to identify individuals at risk.
18446141,"Prospectively gathered data indicate that , with a combination of immunologic and metabolic studies , children with a 6 - year risk of disease higher than 90 % can be identified due to an ongoing immune process."
18446141,They differ from children with overt disease only in the time it will take for glucose levels to rise above a diagnostic threshold.
18446141,Therapies to change the progression of beta - cell loss have been tested in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.
18446141,"With improved predictive capabilities and agents that can have longer - lasting effects than those tested more than 10 years ago , new prevention studies are underway."
18446141,These studies are large and costly but the risks posed by such interventions compare favorably with those of developing hyperglycemia and of future complications portended by the diagnosis of diabetes.
18446141,"In this Review we discuss risk - stratification techniques and how they are applied , other diagnostic criteria , and outcomes from diabetes - prevention trials."
16280645,"The most intensively studied autoimmune disorder , type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM1 ) , has attracted perhaps the greatest interest for gene - based therapeutic and prophylactic interventions."
16280645,"The final clinical manifestation of this immunologically and genetically complex disease , the absence of insulin , is the major starting point for almost all the gene therapy modalities attempted to date."
16280645,"Insulin replacement by transplantation of islets of Langerhans or surrogate beta cells is the obvious choice , but the allogeneic nature of the transplants activates potent antidonor immunoreactivity necessitating gene and cell - based immunosuppressive strategies as an alternative to the toxic pharmacologic immunosuppressives indicated for classic solid organ transplants."
16280645,"Accumulating knowledge of the cellular mechanisms involved in onset , however , have yielded promising tolerance induction prophylactic approaches using genes and cells."
16280645,"Despite the early successes in a number of animal models , the true test of efficacy in humans remains to be demonstrated."
19476469,Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune condition resulting from T cell - mediated destruction of the insulin - producing cells in the islets of Langerhans.
19476469,"Its primary cause remains unknown , but it has been established that the clinical presentation is preceded by a long prodrome."
19476469,This enables individuals at high risk of disease to be identified and offers the possibility of intervention to prevent clinical disease.
19476469,"Many groups are working in this field , concentrating on manipulation of environmental exposures that are potential triggers of autoimmunity and on immunomodulation strategies that aim to prevent destruction of beta - cells."
19476469,"Some interventions have shown promising results in early trials , but effective disease prevention remains elusive."
19476469,This article reviews current progress in the field.
27044339,"Two papers in this issue of Diabetologia present recent trends in life expectancy for people with type 1 diabetes , one using data from an Australian registry ( Huo et al , DOI : 10.1007 / s00125 -015-3857-4 ) , the other , a Swedish registry ( Petrie et al , DOI : 10.1007 / s00125 -016-3914-7 )."
27044339,"This commentary provides a brief review of the concept of the period life expectancy and complexities regarding applicability to patients , before summarising and discussing the main results of the two papers."
27044339,"In addition , some remaining relevant knowledge gaps are discussed."
31081398,"Introduction : Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) has increased dramatically over the last two decades with global variation greater than 350-fold difference reflecting the ethnic , racial , and geographical variation."
31081398,Diabetic patients remain at a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality than those without diabetes.
31081398,"Therefore , it is vital for clinicians to have in - depth knowledge of T1DM statistics and their impact on people health and health resources."
31081398,"Areas covered : This review will cover the epidemiologic characteristics of T1DM and the influence of race , ethnicity , and geographical variation on the incidence and the outcome."
31081398,"The minority populations health disparities in the clinical presentation and outcomes among youth with T1DM , the long - term glycemic control patterns in racially and ethnically diverse youth , and the long - term influence of these factors on cardiovascular outcomes will be elucidated."
31081398,"The PubMed database was searched using the terms : T1DM ± incidence , Race , ethnicity , and Genetic."
31081398,"Expert opinion : Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of T1DM including race , ethnicity and the genetic predisposition will help to develop guidelines target these higher risk patients of an unfavorable outcome."
31081398,"Further research and interventional strategies to identify infants at genetic risk of T1DM may help to prevent , stop or retard the destructive autoimmune process leading to T1DM."
23291464,Type 1 diabetes is increasing dramatically in incidence in the developed world.
23291464,"While there may be several reasons for this , improved sanitation and public health measures have altered our interactions with certain infectious agents such as helminths."
23291464,There is increasing interest in the use of helminths or their products to alleviate inflammatory or allergic conditions.
23291464,"Using rodent models of diabetes , it has been possible to explore the therapeutic potential of both live infections as well as helminth - derived products on the development of autoimmunity."
23291464,This review provides an overview of the findings from animal models and additionally explores the potential for translation to the clinic.
30159816,To provide a current review of closed - loop insulin delivery or artificial pancreas ( AP ) as therapy for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D ) RECENT FINDINGS : The Medtronic Minimed 670G AP system has been in use in clinical practice since March 2017.
30159816,"Currently , Medtronic is conducting a large randomized clinical trial to evaluate its efficacy further in T1D."
30159816,"Simultaneously , the NIH has funded four research consortia to accelerate progress to approval of other AP and decision support systems."
30159816,"Several research groups are currently developing next - generation AP systems , with a number of companies moving toward releasing closed - loop systems in the future."
30159816,AP systems are also being tested in select populations such as hypoglycemia - unaware T1D and pregnant T1D.
30159816,AP research is rapidly advancing.
30159816,The clinical range of AP will be expanded in the next decade.
25294115,Background : The aim of the study was to analyze how metabolic control of type 1 diabetes is related to clinical and microbiological periodontal parameters.
25294115,"Material and methods : The study involved 56 subjects aged from 19 to 50 years divided into 2 groups : healthy subjects ( the H group ) , and diabetic ( type 1 diabetes ) patients with chronic untreated generalized periodontitis ( the DM group )."
25294115,"The glycosylated hemoglobin value ( HbA1c ) was determined using the UniCel DxC 800 SYNCHRON System ( Beckman Coulter , USA ) , and the concentration in blood was measured by the turbidimetric immunoinhibition method."
25294115,"A molecular genetic assay ( Micro-IDent plus , Germany ) was used to detect periodontopathogenic bacteria in plaque samples."
25294115,Periodontitis was confirmed by clinical and radiological examination.
25294115,"Results : Fusobacterium nucleatum , Capnocytophaga species , and Eikenella corrodens were the most frequently found bacteria in dental plaque samples ( 77.8 % , 66.7 % , and 33.4 % , respectively ) , whereas Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified 40.7 % less frequently in the DM group than in the H group."
25294115,The strongest relationship was observed between the presence of 2 periodontal pathogens - F. nucleatum and Capnocytophaga spp. - and poorer metabolic control in type 1 diabetes patients ( HbA1c ) and all clinical parameters of periodontal pathology.
25294115,"Conclusions : Periodontal disease was more evident in type 1 diabetic patients , and the prevalence of periodontitis was greatly increased in subjects with poorer metabolic control."
24582332,Autoimmune diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders affecting different organs and tissues.
24582332,"New tools , such as genome - wide association studies , have provided evidence for new susceptibility loci and candidate genes in the disease process including common susceptibility genes involved in the immunological synapse and T cell activation."
24582332,"Close linkages have been found in a number of diseases , including ankylosing spondylitis , multiple sclerosis , Crohn 's disease and insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( Type 1 diabetes mellitus )."
24582332,"Evidence for some association with Type 1 diabetes was previously found in the region containing 5q15 / ERAP1 ( endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 ) ( rs30187 , ARTS1 )."
24582332,"Recent data suggest that in eukaryotic cells in addition to the ubiquitin / proteasome system another proteolytic pathway may have a significant role in the autoimmunity process , i.e. the autophagic pathway which constitutes the principal regulated catabolic process mediated by lysosomes."
24582332,Autophagy could play a role in MHC class I and class II self - antigen presentation at the basis of the autoimmunity process.
24582332,Furthermore cross-talk among different proteolytic pathways was recently highlighted i.e. components processed in the ubiquitin / proteasome system possibly engaged in autophagic pathways.
24582332,T1D is an autoimmune disease characterised by the destruction of pancreatic beta cells by autoreactive T cells.
24582332,Immunological abnormalities can precede months to years the initial symptoms and clinical diagnosis.
24582332,"Our hypothesis suggests that in the autoimmune process autophagy can intervene at different levels , during the thymic selection process of T lymphocytes causing escape of autoreactive T cells , at the initiation stage of the disease , in the preclinical period or subsequently to the disease onset having a role at the level of perpetuation of the autoimmunity process."
24582332,Supporting evidence derives from the already reported discovery of polymorphisms in autophagy - related genes in patients affected by several autoimmune conditions such as Systemic Lupus Erithematosus.
24582332,In addition deregulated autophagy was detected in T cells from lupus - prone mice and also found in T cells from patients.
24582332,Autophagy was found activated in osteoclasts from RA patients as demonstrated by the increased expression of Atg7 and Beclin - 1.
24582332,"Our hypothesis to be unraveled could have , if correct , relevant implications for the management of autoimmune conditions such as Type 1 diabetes."
24582332,"In principle , novel therapeutic approaches could be established by targeting deregulated autophagy offering novel opportunities to personalized medicine in patients affected by the disease."
21043053,"Fulminant type 1 diabetes is a recently discovered subtype of idiopathic type 1 diabetes , defined as diabetes with an extremely rapid process of β - cell destruction and progression to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis."
21043053,"In this report , we present a case of fulminant type 1 diabetes in a 45 - year - old Chinese woman , along with a review of the literature."
21043053,The patient presented with sudden onset of polydipsia and polyuria after flu - like symptoms.
21043053,"Findings on admission included a high blood glucose level and ketoacidosis , but normal HbA1c level."
21043053,The C - peptide stimulation test showed severe impairment of insulin secretion.
21043053,Autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) were negative.
21043053,These results are compatible with the diagnosis of fulminant type 1 diabetes.
21043053,Human leukocyte antigen - DR7 ( HLA - DR7 ) was available in this case.
21043053,"It is concluded that this rapidly progressing type of diabetes exists , and we propose that HLA - DR7 might be predisposed to fulminant type 1 diabetes in Chinese patients."
22753003,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is due , in part , to non-genetically determined factors including environmental factors."
22753003,The nature of these environmental effects remains unclear but they are important to identify since they may be amenable to therapy.
22753003,"Recently , the gut microbiota , the trillions of microorganisms inhabiting the gut , as well as diet , have been implicated in T1DM pathogenesis."
22753003,"Since dietary changes can reshape this complex gut community , its co-evolution could have been altered by changes to our diet , agriculture , personal hygiene , and antibiotic usage , which coincide with the increased incidence of T1DM."
22753003,Recent studies demonstrate an association between altered gut microbiota and T1DM in both T1DM patients and animal models of the disease.
22753003,"Further studies should provide new insight into those critical host - microbial interactions , potentially suggesting new diagnostic or therapeutic strategies for disease prevention."
20412757,A combination of genetic and immunological features is useful for prediction of autoimmune diabetes.
20412757,"Patterns of immune response correspond to the progression from a preclinical phase of disease to end - stage islet damage , with biomarkers indicating transition from susceptibility to active autoimmunity , and to a final loss of immune regulation."
20412757,"Here , we review the markers that provide evidence for immunological checkpoint failure and that also provide tools for assessment of individualized disease risk."
20412757,"When viewed in the context of genetic variation that influences immune response thresholds , progression from susceptibility to overt disease displays predictable modalities of clinical presentation resulting from a sequential series of failed homeostatic checkpoints for selection and activation of immunity."
17412305,"Every year , thirty thousand people worldwide are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM )."
17412305,"T1DM , also called autoimmune diabetes , is a multifactorial disease affecting predisposed individuals and involving genetic susceptibilities , environmental triggers , as well as unbalanced immune responses."
17412305,"Auto - reactive T cells , produced during the pathogenesis , play an important role by specifically destroying the pancreatic insulin - producing beta - cells in the islets of Langerhans."
17412305,"Numerous therapeutic interventions have been tested , mostly in animal models , but also in humans."
17412305,"To date , only three phase II / III clinical trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy : anti-CD3 antibody , DiaPep277 , and GAD65 ( in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults )."
17412305,"Unfortunately , a significant number of patients did not respond positively and remained insulin - dependent after completion of therapy."
17412305,Several reasons account for this.
17412305,"Firstly , the severity of the disease as well as the auto - aggressive T cell repertoire vary from patient to patient leading to a broad range of therapeutic efficacies , and secondly at the time of the treatment the number of remaining beta - cells will directly impact the level of insulin production post-treatment."
17412305,"In this review , we will provide some clues to enhance efficacy of future immuno - interventions in patients with T1DM."
17412305,We suggest that combination therapies might be the best approach.
28188825,The gut microbiota interact with innate immune cells and play an important role in shaping the immune system.
28188825,"Many factors may influence the composition of the microbiota such as mode of birth , diet , infections and medication including antibiotics."
28188825,"In diseases with a multifactorial etiology , like type 1 diabetes , manipulation and alterations of the microbiota in animal models have been shown to influence the incidence and onset of disease."
28188825,The microbiota are an important part of the internal environment and understanding how these bacteria interact with the innate immune cells to generate immune tolerance may open up opportunities for development of new therapeutic strategies.
28188825,"In this review , we discuss recent findings in relation to the microbiota , particularly in the context of type 1 diabetes."
22168424,The last several years have seen breakthroughs in techniques to track the symbiont communities that normally colonize mammals ( the microbiota ) and in cataloguing the universe of the genes they carry ( the microbiome ).
22168424,"Applying these methods to human patients and corresponding murine models should allow us to decipher just how the microbiota impacts type - 1 diabetes , i.e. which particular microbes are responsible and the cellular and molecular processes that are involved."
22168424,"Here , at its threshold , we set the stage for what promises to be an exciting rejuvenated area of investigation."
20491795,Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease whose clinical onset signifies a lifelong requirement for insulin therapy and increased risk of medical complications.
20491795,"To increase the efficiency and confidence with which drug candidates advance to human type 1 diabetes clinical trials , we have generated and validated a mathematical model of type 1 diabetes pathophysiology in a well - characterized animal model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes , the non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mouse."
20491795,The model is based on an extensive survey of the public literature and input from an independent scientific advisory board.
20491795,"It reproduces key disease features including activation and expansion of autoreactive lymphocytes in the pancreatic lymph nodes ( PLNs ) , islet infiltration and beta cell loss leading to hyperglycaemia."
20491795,"The model uses ordinary differential and algebraic equations to represent the pancreas and PLN as well as dynamic interactions of multiple cell types ( e.g. dendritic cells , macrophages , CD4 + T lymphocytes , CD8 + T lymphocytes , regulatory T cells , beta cells )."
20491795,The simulated features of untreated pathogenesis and disease outcomes for multiple interventions compare favourably with published experimental data.
20491795,"Thus , a mathematical model reproducing type 1 diabetes pathophysiology in the NOD mouse , validated based on accurate reproduction of results from multiple published interventions , is available for in silico hypothesis testing."
20491795,Predictive biosimulation research evaluating therapeutic strategies and underlying biological mechanisms is intended to deprioritize hypotheses that impact disease outcome weakly and focus experimental research on hypotheses likely to provide insight into the disease and its treatment.
23786297,George Eisenbarth 's pioneering and visionary research has provided a critical foundation that will be built on in the years ahead as we progress toward prevention of type 1 diabetes.
23786297,His almost 30 - year old model that type 1 diabetes was a chronic and predictable autoimmune disease with multiple identifiable progressive stages with a potential for interventions to prevent progression to symptomatic diabetes has stood the test of time.
23786297,"To deliver on the Eisenbarth vision and his "" unfinished journey , "" the field needs : ( 1 ) to improve detection of risk of type 1 diabetes , ( 2 ) to improve staging and prediction of progression , ( 3 ) to perform smaller , shorter , practical , and an increased number of prevention clinical trials , and ( 4 ) to increase awareness of the potential for risk detection , staging , and prevention of type 1 diabetes and benefit / risk of prevention."
7821148,Type I diabetes is probably due to the immune - mediated destruction of islet insulin - secreting beta - cells.
7821148,"This chronic destructive process is associated with both cellular and humoral immune changes in the peripheral blood that can be detected months , even years , before the onset of clinical diabetes."
7821148,"Throughout this prediabetic period , metabolic changes , including altered glucose tolerance and reduced insulin secretion , deteriorate at variable rates toward full - blown diabetes."
7821148,The ability to predict subsequent clinical diabetes in those nondiabetic individuals with immune and metabolic changes has led to attempts to prevent the disease onset by therapeutic intervention.
7821148,A small fraction of individuals with immune changes develop clinical diabetes that does not require insulin treatment.
7821148,"The onset of diabetes in these cases is usually in adult life , and because their diabetes is , at least initially , not insulin - dependent , they appear clinically to have type II diabetes."
7821148,Such patients probably have the same disease process as patients with type I diabetes in that they have similar human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) genetic susceptibility as well as autoantibodies to islet antigens.
7821148,It is proposed that non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients who have markers that characterize individuals at risk of type I diabetes may be suitable candidates for those same therapeutic strategies that seek to prevent progression to insulin - dependence or even to reestablish normal glucose tolerance.
26477482,ackground : Markedly elevated plasma glucose and relatively low HbA1c compared to plasma glucose is one diagnostic criterion for fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus ( FT1DM ).
26477482,Glycated albumin ( GA ) is a glycemic control marker that reflects glycemic control in shorter period than HbA1c.
26477482,This study investigated whether GA is useful for differential diagnosis between FT1DM and acute - onset autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1ADM ) or not.
26477482,Methods : This study included 38 FT1DM patients and 31 T1ADM patients in whom both HbA1c and GA were measured at the time of diagnosis.
26477482,"Results : In FT1DM patients , as compared to T1ADM patients , both HbA1c and GA were significantly lower ( HbA1c ; 6.6 ± 0.9 % vs. 11.7 ± 2.6 % , P < 0.0001 , GA ; 22.9 ± 4.8 % vs. 44.3 ± 8.3 % , P < 0.0001 )."
26477482,"For differential diagnosis between FT1DM and T1ADM , ROC analysis showed that the optimum cut - off value for GA was 33.5 % with sensitivity and specificity of 97.4 % and 96.8 % , respectively , while the optimum cut - off value for HbA1c was 8.7 % with sensitivity and specificity of 100 % and 83.9 % , respectively."
26477482,Conclusions : GA also may be useful for the differential diagnosis between FT1DM and T1ADM when the cut - off value can be set at 33.5 %.
9729705,The authors describe the successful treatment of a 17 - year - old female with comorbid type 1 diabetes mellitus and anorexia nervosa within the context of a residential program in a tertiary care facility.
9729705,"Assessment and treatment of the complex combinations of the psychological and medical symptoms involved in this patient required the interaction of medical , psychological , and nutritional services."
9729705,Diagnostic and treatment challenges are discussed.
23745648,Aims and objectives : To examine the weight loss concerns of young adults with type 1 diabetes.
23745648,Background : Eating disorders are prevalent in young women with type 1 diabetes.
23745648,Design : Qualitative.
23745648,Methods : Interviews with 35 young adults ( 23 - 30 years of age ) with type 1 diabetes and 13 healthcare professionals.
23745648,Results : Most female interviewees were concerned about the difficulties of losing weight when having diabetes.
23745648,Six female interviewees developed severe eating disturbances when they were younger.
23745648,These women initially regarded their disturbed eating behaviour positively and engaged in weight loss activities intermittently.
23745648,"However , over time , they lost control of their behaviour , and it came to dominate their lives."
23745648,Family conflict often intensified disordered eating behaviours.
23745648,"Eventually all of these women managed to transition away from their behaviour , although this process took , for some of them , several years."
23745648,"Several of them ( now in their early to late twenties ) , however , continued to struggle with weight loss impulses."
23745648,Healthcare professionals felt that eating - and weight - related issues often went undiagnosed and undocumented in young adult women with type 1 diabetes.
23745648,"Conclusion : Many young women with type 1 diabetes are worried about their weight , but will not engage in risky weight loss activities because of concerns about their health."
23745648,A minority of young adult women will develop more severe eating - related disturbances.
23745648,These eating disturbances may last a significant amount of time before clinicians become aware of them.
23745648,These women may also experience disordered weight loss impulses for sometime after clinical interventions.
23745648,Relevance to clinical practice : Clinicians should screen young adult women with type 1 diabetes for eating disorders and monitor young adult women who have developed eating disorders over the longer term.
23745648,There may be a need to provide asymptomatic young women with diabetes with information about the potential risks of insulin omission.
12085460,Adolescents with Type 1 diabetes have poorer glycemic control and more hypoglycemia than do adults.
12085460,"While physiologic reasons for these problems exist , the most common problems are failure to administer insulin , monitor glucose levels , and maintain an appropriate meal plan."
18053255,Background : Patients with type 1 diabetes are known to have a higher hospital admission rate than the underlying population and may also be admitted for procedures that would normally be carried out on a day surgery basis for non-diabetics.
18053255,Emergency admission rates have sometimes been used as indicators of quality of diabetes care.
18053255,"In preparation for a study of hospital admissions , a systematic review was carried out on hospital admissions for children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes , whilst under the age of 15."
18053255,"The main thrust of this review was to ascertain where there were gaps in the literature for studies investigating post-diagnosis hospitalisations , rather than to try to draw conclusions from the disparate data sets."
18053255,"Methods : A systematic search of the electronic databases PubMed , Cochrane LibrarMEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted for the period 1986 to 2006 , to identify publications relating to hospital admissions subsequent to the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes under the age of 15."
18053255,"Results : Thirty - two publications met all inclusion criteria , 16 in Northern America , 11 in Europe and 5 in Australasia."
18053255,Most of the studies selected were focussed on diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) or diabetes - related hospital admissions and only four studies included data on all admissions.
18053255,"Admission rates with DKA as primary diagnosis varied widely between 0.01 to 0.18 per patient - year as did those for other diabetes - related co-morbidity ranging from 0.05 to 0.38 per patient year , making it difficult to interpret data from different study designs."
18053255,"However , people with Type 1 diabetes are three times more likely to be hospitalised than the non-diabetic populations and stay in hospital twice as long."
18053255,Conclusion : Few studies report on all admissions to hospital in patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes whilst under the age of 15 years.
18053255,Health care costs for type 1 patients are higher than those for the general population and information on associated patterns of hospitalisation might help to target interventions to reduce the cost of hospital admissions.
21465326,"Aims / hypothesis : Comorbidities are frequent among type 1 diabetes patients on renal replacement therapy , yet the effect of comorbidities on survival is unknown."
21465326,Our aim was to estimate this effect.
21465326,Methods : An incident cohort of all patients with type 1 diabetes entering chronic renal replacement therapy ( n = 656 ) in Finland between 2000 and 2008 was followed until death or the end of follow - up on 31 December 2008.
21465326,"All data were obtained from the Finnish Registry for Kidney Diseases , which collects information on comorbidities at the start of renal replacement therapy."
21465326,The main outcome measure was relative risk of death according to comorbidities.
21465326,"Results : At start of renal replacement therapy , 22 % of the patients with type 1 diabetes had coronary artery disease , 19 % peripheral vascular disease , 11 % cerebrovascular disease , 33 % left ventricular hypertrophy and 7 % heart failure."
21465326,All these comorbidities were significant predictors of death in univariate analyses ( RR 1.6 - 4.9 ).
21465326,"The 5 year survival probability of patients without comorbidities was 74 % , while it was 56 % and 37 % , respectively , for those with one or more than one comorbidity."
21465326,"When the comorbidities were studied in a multivariate model , adjusting for age and sex , peripheral vascular disease ( RR 1.9 ) , left ventricular hypertrophy ( RR 1.7 ) and heart failure ( RR 2.5 ) remained independent risk factors for death."
21465326,Calculations indicated that one - third of deaths in the study population could be attributed to comorbidities.
21465326,"Conclusions / interpretation : Among patients with type 1 diabetes entering renal replacement therapy , comorbidities are common and strong predictors of death."
21465326,"Therefore , it is essential to identify and adequately treat comorbidities."
31083260,"Assessment of sedentary behaviors in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , relative to the method of insulin therapy used , and in comparison to healthy controls.The study group consisted of 215 children with T1D , including 109 ( 50.7 % ) insulin pen and 106 ( 49.3 % ) insulqsain pump users."
31083260,The control group comprised 115 healthy children.
31083260,"The subjects ' sedentary time was measured with a tri-axial accelerometer ActiGraph GT3X + , used continuously for 7 days.The diabetes group was characterized by a significantly higher "" % in sedentary time "" score ( P = .024 ) and a lower "" mean daily breaks in sedentary time "" result ( P = .007 ) , which means that they spent much more time on sedentary activities compared to the control group."
31083260,"There were no significant differences between the children using insulin pump and insulin pen in the "" % in sedentary time "" score ( P = .294 ) and "" mean daily breaks in sedentary time "" ( P = .251 )."
31083260,"The T1D is a serious encumbrance , leading to longer duration of sedentary time , in comparison to healthy controls."
31083260,The type of insulin therapy did not significantly affect the percentage of the wear - day spent in sedentary time and mean daily breaks in sedentary time.
27812145,Aims : Diagnoses of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) in Europe appear to be on the rise.
27812145,Therefore it is imperative that researchers understand the potential impact that increases in prevalence could have on the affected individuals as well as on society as a whole.
27812145,"Accordingly this study examined the humanistic and economic burden of T1DM in patients relative to those without the condition across a number of health outcomes including health status , work productivity loss , activity impairment , and healthcare resource use."
27812145,"Methods : Survey data from a large , representative sample of EU adults ( The EU National Health and Wellness Survey ) were examined."
27812145,Results : Results suggest that overall burden is higher for those diagnosed with T1DM than respondents without diabetes and that burden increases as complications associated with T1DM increase.
27812145,"Conclusions : Taken together , these results suggest that treatment strategies for T1DM should balance clinical , humanistic , and economic burden and patients should be educated on the role of complications in disease outcomes."
16492429,"Objective : To determine whether stabilizing serum glucose , via introduction of an insulin pump , improves classroom attention among children with type - 1 diabetes mellitus."
16492429,Study design : Four boys having type - 1 diabetes mellitus with unstable serum glucose were observed in their classroom for 10 baseline days.
16492429,"An insulin pump was placed and serum glucose stabilized , and they were then observed again for 10 days."
16492429,A modified multiple baseline design was used to determine if improved on - task and off - task behavior was associated with better glycemic control.
16492429,"Rating scales and a laboratory measure of attention , measures of secondary interest , were also administered before and after pump introduction , and potential improvement in individuals ' scores was evaluated."
16492429,Results : All boys had apparent improvement in on - task and off - task behavior as observed in their classrooms.
16492429,"Improvements were substantial , averaging 20 % in on - task behavior and 34 % in off - task behavior."
16492429,"However , no changes were detected on rating scales or laboratory measures."
16492429,"Conclusion : This study offers preliminary evidence that stabilizing serum glucose improves classroom attention , although the effect was detected only by observation of classroom behavior using highly structured techniques."
16492429,"Consequently , use of direct observation techniques may be important in studying the effects of chronic illness on classroom functioning."
23572052,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D ) is a chronic , multifactorial autoimmune disease that involves the progressive destruction of pancreatic β - cells , ultimately resulting in the loss of insulin production and secretion."
23572052,"The goal of clinical intervention is to prevent or arrest the onset and progression of autoimmunity , reverse β - cell destruction , and restore glycometabolic and immune homeostasis."
23572052,"Despite promising outcomes observed with islet transplantation and advancements in immunomodulatory therapies , the need for an effective cell replacement strategy for curing T1D still persists."
23572052,Stem cell therapy offers a solution to the cited challenges of islet transplantation.
23572052,"While the regenerative potential of stem cells can be harnessed to make available a self - replenishing supply of glucose - responsive insulin - producing cells , their immunomodulatory properties may potentially be used to prevent , arrest , or reverse autoimmunity , ameliorate innate / alloimmune graft rejection , and prevent recurrence of the disease."
23572052,"Herein , we discuss the therapeutic potential of stem cells derived from a variety of sources for the cure of T1D , for example , embryonic stem cells , induced pluripotent stem cells , bone marrow - derived hematopoietic stem cells , and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells derived from bone marrow , umbilical cord blood , and adipose tissue."
23572052,"The benefits of combinatorial approaches designed to ensure the successful clinical translation of stem cell therapeutic strategies , such as approaches combining effective stem cell strategies with islet transplantation , immunomodulatory drug regimens , and / or novel bioengineering techniques , are also discussed."
23572052,"To conclude , the application of stem cell therapy in the cure for T1D appears extremely promising."
19408118,Type I diabetes is a chronic illness that most frequently develops during childhood.
19408118,"As a medical doctor with an understanding of psychology and human development , the psychiatrist is in a unique position to guide the child or adolescent with diabetes and his family through the typical lifestyle adjustments that are encountered when diagnosed with diabetes."
19408118,"This article presents an overview of the diagnosis and management of type I diabetes , reviews the ways in which diabetes will interact with child development , and discusses the increased rates of eating disorders and mood disorders among children with type I diabetes."
19408118,There is a distinct role for the psychiatrist to be involved in the diabetes care team of children and adolescents diagnosed with type I diabetes and this role can be medically crucial.
26771087,Poor adherence to self - care among youth with type - 1 diabetes ( YWD ) can lead to significant long - term health problems.
26771087,"Negative diabetes - related emotions ( NDRE ) are common , and are significantly correlated with poor / deteriorating A1c."
26771087,"Resilient youth handle diabetes self - care challenges , such as adjusting for diabetes in public , better."
26771087,"Resiliency skills and perceptions include benefit finding ( BF ) , fitting in with friends ( FI ) , diabetes acceptance ( DA ) , emotion processing ( EP ) and emotion expression ( EE )."
26771087,"First study goal : to verify structure of underlying measurement variables : NDRE , EP , EE , BF , DA , FI and comfort in adjusting for diabetes in public ( CA ) among youth 11 - 16 yr of age with diabetes."
26771087,"We also hypothesize : ( i ) YWD who engage in EP and EE will have higher levels of BF , FI , DA , ( ii ) EP and EE will moderate NDRE impact and ( iii ) higher levels of EP , EE , BF , FI and DA will be associated with higher CA."
26771087,Subjects : 243 summer diabetes campers between 11 - 16 yr of age.
26771087,Methods : Pre-camp survey.
26771087,Results : Measurement variables were verified.
26771087,"EP and EE to friends were positively associated with BF , FI and DA for most YWD."
26771087,"NDRE was negatively associated with FI and DA , and for YWD aged 14 - 16 yr with CA."
26771087,FI was positively associated with CA.
26771087,EE moderated the impact of NDRE on CA among youth 11 - 13 yr.
26771087,"R2 for CA in youth 14 - 16 yr was 48.2 % , for 11 - 13 yr was 38.3 %."
26771087,DA was positively associated with CA for youth 14 - 16 yr.
26771087,Conclusions : Resilience factors appear to influence CA either directly or indirectly.
11979016,The incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing worldwide and the disease is an onerous burden both to the individual and to society.
11979016,There are thus important reasons to screen for the disease before it becomes manifest : ( 1 ) to improve understanding of the natural history of the prediabetic period ; ( 2 ) to gain further insights into the immunopathogenesis of the disease ; ( 3 ) to identify individuals for prevention trials ; ( 4 ) to make an earlier diagnosis in order to reduce morbidity and mortality.
11979016,"Great strides have been made , yet there is still a great deal to be learned."
11979016,"Opponents of screening argue that screening tests for the disease have a low positive predictive value and that predicting the disease without a primary prevention capability raises ethical considerations because of induced stress , lifestyle changes , cost and potential effects on insurability."
11979016,The greatest single barrier against large - scale population screening and prevention of the disease remains the lack of an effective intervention.
11979016,"However , screening in the context of well - designed research studies must continue - ultimately the benefit to the individual and to society will be immense."
23912764,"Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) research has made great strides over the past decade with advances in understanding the pathogenesis , natural history , candidate environmental exposures , exposure triggering time , disease prediction , and diagnosis."
23912764,"Major monitoring efforts have provided baseline historical measures , leading to better epidemiological studies incorporating longitudinal biosamples ( ie , biobanks ) , which have allowed for new technologies ( ' omics ' ) to further expose the etiological agents responsible for the initiation , progression , and eventual clinical onset of T1D."
23912764,"These new frontiers have brought forth high - dimensionality data , which have furthered the evidence of the heterogeneous nature of T1D pathogenesis and allowed for a more mechanistic approach in understanding the etiology of T1D."
23912764,"This review will expand on the most recent advances in the quest for T1D determinants , drawing upon novel research tools that epidemiology , genetics , microbiology , and immunology have provided , linking them to the major hypotheses associated with T1D etiology , and discussing the future frontiers."
11554777,The prevention of diabetes and its devastating complications is the prime goal of diabetes care.
11554777,"In immune - mediated type 1 diabetes , beta cell destruction can be predicted with increasing confidence both before and after diagnosis , thus allowing the development of preventative strategies."
11554777,"Multicentre clinical trials with the natural products insulin and nicotinamide have been launched , but the results will only be available in a few years time."
11554777,"Meanwhile , observational studies in large representative risk groups can help to refine the selection of subjects with a more homogenous risk for beta cell destruction , thereby reducing the need for large sample sizes."
11554777,The comparison between biological markers and disease progression will help to define surrogate disease end - points that can be monitored before the hard clinical end - points of hyperglycaemia or remission.
11554777,These advances will facilitate the start of new pilot trials to identify relatively safe candidate interventions adapted to disease stage.
8805027,Type 1 diabetes may appear at any age.
8805027,The onset may be insidious and even asymptomatic for a long time.
8805027,"The prediabetic stage is characterized by genetic susceptibility , the presence of autoantibodies in serum , and gradual impairment of the beta - cell function."
8805027,HLA - DQ - encoded heterodimers are strongly associated with increased risk / protection.
8805027,"Additional diabetogenic genes are present in other chromosomes , different from HLA region genes."
8805027,Screening of prediabetes is usually restricted to first - degree relatives of type 1 diabetic subjects.
8805027,Islet cell antibody ( ICA ) - positive gestational diabetic women form a subset of patients with increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes shortly after pregnancy.
8805027,Optimization of metabolic control is the key strategy for preventing late diabetic complications.
8805027,"Diabetic education , intensive insulin therapy and regular screening for early detection are critical in achieving this goal."
8805027,"Individual monitoring of subjects at high risk for developing hypoglycaemias , and development of more adequate short - and long - acting insulin analogues represent important measures to avoid hypoglycaemia and associated risks."
8805027,Effective delivery of care for type 1 diabetic subjects requires the operation of a continuous quality assessment programme.
30027655,The aim of the study was to evaluate the neurofunctional effect of gender in Type - 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) patients during a Visual Spatial Working Memory ( VSWM ) task.
30027655,The study included 28 participants with ages ranging from 17 - 28 years.
30027655,"Fourteen well - controlled T1DM patients ( 7 female ) and 14 controls matched by age , sex , and education level were scanned performing a block - design VSWM paradigm."
30027655,"Behavioral descriptive analyses and mean comparisons were done , and between - group and condition functional activation patterns were also compared."
30027655,"Whole - brain cumulative BOLD signal ( CumBS ) , voxel-wise BOLD level frequency , Euclidean distance , and divergence indices were also calculated."
30027655,There were no significant differences between or within - group sex differences for correct responses and reaction times.
30027655,"Functional activation analyses showed that females had activation in more brain regions , and with larger clusters of cortical activations than males."
30027655,"Furthermore , BOLD activation was higher in males."
30027655,"Despite the preliminary nature of the present study given the relatively small sample size , current results acknowledge for the first time that sex might contribute to differences in functional activation in T1DM patients."
30027655,Findings suggest that sex differences should be considered when studying T1DM - disease development.
15229377,"Animal models of type 1 diabetes remain essential tools for investigation of the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease and , importantly , for the development of effective new treatments."
15229377,"Although a range of well - characterized and widely used models of type 1 diabetes in rodents are currently available , large animal models are a valuable complement to rodent models for both physiological and practical reasons."
15229377,"The pig is very useful in many aspects as a model for human physiology and pathophysiology because many organ systems of this species , as well as physiological and pathophysiological responses , resemble those of the human."
15229377,"The Göttingen minipig is particularly suitable for long - term studies because of its inherent small size and ease of handling , even at full maturity."
15229377,"Of particular relevance to the field of type 1 diabetes are the many similarities evident between humans and pigs with regard to pharmacokinetics of compounds after subcutaneous administration , structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract , morphology of the pancreas , and the overall metabolic status of the two species."
15229377,"Because spontaneous type 1 - like diabetes is very rare in pigs , a model of the condition must be induced experimentally , either surgically or chemically."
15229377,"This process is discussed , and the use of the pig as a model in islet transplantation and diabetic complications is briefly summarized."
24746688,Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is an autoimmune disease ultimately leading to destruction of insulin secreting β - cells in the pancreas.
24746688,"Genetic susceptibility plays an important role in T1D etiology , but even mono - zygotic twins only have a concordance rate of around 50 % , underlining that other factors than purely genetic are involved in disease development."
24746688,Here we review the influence of dietary and environmental factors on T1D development in humans as well as animal models.
24746688,"Even though data are still inconclusive , there are strong indications that gut microbiota dysbiosis plays an important role in T1D development and evidence from animal models suggests that gut microbiota manipulation might prove valuable in future prevention of T1D in genetically susceptible individuals."
22558802,Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is an increasingly encountered chronic illness in Saudi Arabia.
22558802,"It is known to have an immune - mediated pathogenesis , which results in the loss of insulin - secreting beta - cells responsible for maintaining normal blood glucose levels."
22558802,"The three main autoantibodies identified to play a role in the pathogenesis are islet cell antibodies ( ICA ) , insulin autoantibodies ( IAA ) and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies ( GAD )."
22558802,"This study aims to determine at what age during childhood the autoantibodies ICA , IAA and GAD are most prevalent , and identify any correlation between their presence and the severity of the initial clinical presentation."
22558802,"Medical records of children diagnosed with T1DM in Riyadh in 2000 - 2007 were reviewed , and a total of 98 patients were included in the study ( age range : 1 - 12 years , mean : 6.6 years , equal numbers by gender ) , of which 49 % presented with diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA )."
22558802,"Results showed that 67 % were positive for ICA , 36 % for IAA and 84.4 % for GAD."
22558802,The presence of ICA was predominant in children aged under six years.
22558802,The presence of ICA and GAD in the absence of IAA was associated with more severe clinical presentation.
9822187,"Type 1 diabetes is increasing rapidly in many parts of the Western world , most evidently in Scandinavia."
9822187,"A low concordance rate of insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus among monozygotic twins clearly indicates that genetic risk factors may be necessary , but are not sufficient for the disease to occur."
9822187,"The strongest genetic risk markers are located in the HLA region of chromosome 6 , but these DNA specificities differ in different populations."
9822187,"Risk genes are indicated in other chromosomes of the human genome , suggesting a complex interaction between genes and environment as the cause of the disease."
9822187,The pathogenesis of the disease is proposed to be autoimmune in nature and environmental risk factors may either initiate autoimmunity or accelerate an already ongoing beta - cell destruction.
9822187,"Risk factors disclosed by epidemiological studies that may accelerate the pathogenetic process are : a cold environment , a high growth rate , infections and stressful life events."
9822187,"Risk factors that may initiate the autoimmune process include early exposure to cow 's milk proteins , nitrosamines or early foetal events such as blood group incompatibility or foetal viral infections."
9822187,"In conclusion , population - based epidemiological studies have helped to confirm proposed aetiological models that have arisen from experimental research."
9822187,These epidemiological studies have also introduced important new findings that may reveal the complex aetiology of the disease and advance understanding closer to the ultimate goal of primary prevention.
25713991,Type 1 diabetes results from selective destruction of insulin - producing pancreatic β - cells by a progressive autoimmune process.
25713991,"Type 1 diabetes proves very heterogeneous in pathology , disease progression and efficacy of therapeutic intervention."
25713991,"Indeed , several immunotherapies that appear ineffective for the entire treated patient population in fact look promising in subgroups of patients."
25713991,It therefore seems inconceivable that one standard therapy will provide the golden bullet of disease intervention.
25713991,"Instead , personalized medicine may improve immune intervention efficacy rates."
25713991,"We discuss the effect of disease heterogeneity on treatment outcome of immunotherapies , identifying apparent gaps in our understanding of treatment efficacy in subgroups of Type 1 diabetic patients as well as identifying future opportunities for immunotherapy."
19323958,Girls and women with type 1 diabetes have increased rates of disturbed eating behaviors and clinically significant eating disorders than their nondiabetic peers.
19323958,"Type 1 diabetes is strongly associated with several empirically supported eating disorder risk factors ( eg , higher body mass index , increased body weight and shape dissatisfaction , low self - esteem and depression , and dietary restraint )."
19323958,It may be that specific aspects of diabetes treatment increase the risk for developing disordered eating.
19323958,Disturbed eating behaviors and clinical eating disorders predispose women with diabetes to many complex medical risks and increase risk of morbidity and mortality.
19323958,"For this reason , it is critical that diabetes clinicians understand more about eating disorders to improve the likelihood of early risk detection and access to appropriate treatment."
19323958,This article presents a review of the current scientific literature on eating disturbances in type 1 diabetes and synthesizes the existent findings into recommendations for screening and treatment.
18809649,"Background : The connection between oral health and systemic health is bidirectional ; systemic illnesses , especially metabolic disorders , affect oral health , and it appears that oral health may affect systemic health."
18809649,"Methods : In this review , the authors outline the basic principles behind diabetes mellitus ( DM ) and provide some tips to help dentists manage the care of patients with DM better in general practice."
18809649,"Results : DM negatively affects all microvasculature beds , and the soft tissues and bones supporting the teeth are susceptible."
18809649,There is also strong evidence that the presence of periodontal disease is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity in patients with DM.
18809649,"Conclusions : DM is a chronic , systemic metabolic disorder in which the orosystemic connection is becoming more understood."
18809649,"Clinical implications : DM is a relatively common condition and , thus , is one that practicing dentists may encounter frequently."
23648893,In type 1 diabetic patients insulin - producing pancreatic β - cells are destroyed by an orchestrated immune process involving self - reactive auto - antigen - specific CD4 ⁺ and CD8 ⁺ T cells.
23648893,"Efforts to reverse or prevent this destructive immunological cascade have led to promising results in animal models , however , the transition to the clinic has yet been unsuccessful."
23648893,"In addition , current clinical studies lack reliable biomarkers to circumscribe end - point parameters and define therapeutic success."
23648893,"Here , we give a current overview of both antigen - specific and non-specific systemic immunomodulatory approaches with a focus on the therapies verified or under evaluation in a clinical setting."
23648893,"While both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages , rationally designed combination therapies may yield the highest therapeutic efficacy."
23648893,"In order for future strategies to be effective , new well - defined biomarkers need to be developed and the extrapolation process of dose , timing and frequency from in vivo models to patients needs to be carefully reconsidered."
12116172,Type 1 insulin - dependent diabetes is due to destruction of the insulin secreting cells of the islets of Langerhans.
12116172,"The disease is caused by non-genetic , probably environmental , factors operating in a genetically susceptible host to initiate a destructive immune process."
12116172,"These unknown environmental factors may operate over a limited period either in early or later and to a variable degree , playing a particularly substantial role in adults."
12116172,The environment then induces an immune process associated with destruction of the islet beta cell that can be detected in early life and persists up to disease onset.
12116172,"Apart from an association with the insulin gene there is no evidence that genes associated with type 1 diabetes , including HLA and CTLA4 influence the targeting of the immune response to the insulin - secreting cells."
12116172,The critical period of immune activation is probably short and the process leading to diabetes probably has a long prodrome but of variable duration that determines the age at presentation with clinical disease.
12116172,"The amplification both of this immune response and the destructive process is in part genetically determined , involving HLA genes."
12116172,"The clinical spectrum of the disease process associated with type 1 diabetes is wide , encompassing insulin - dependence , non-insulin dependence and even transient impaired glucose tolerance."
12116172,"Type 1 diabetes presenting in adults , in contrast to children , is predominantly determined by non-genetic factors with a reduced role for protective and susceptibility HLA alleles."
12116172,"Thus , the evidence is that genes involved in genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes operate predominantly in children not adults and in both amplify the immune response and the rate of disease progression."
25880886,Background : Genetic and non-genetic factors probably act together to initiate and accelerate development of type 1 diabetes [ T1D ].
25880886,One suggested risk factor contributing to development of T1D is air pollution.
25880886,"Objective : The aim of the study was to investigate whether maternal exposure during pregnancy to air pollution , measured as nitrogen oxides [ NOx ] and ozone , in a low - dose exposure area was associated with the child developing T1D."
25880886,"Method : In Scania ( Skåne ) , the most southern county in Sweden , 84,039 infants were born during the period 1999 - 2005."
25880886,"By the end of April 2013 , 324 of those children had been diagnosed with T1D."
25880886,For each of those T1D children three control children were randomly selected and matched for HLA genotype and birth year.
25880886,"Individually modelled exposure data at residence during pregnancy were assessed for nitrogen oxides [ NOx ] , traffic density and ozone."
25880886,Results : Ozone as well as NOx exposures were associated with T1D.
25880886,When the highest exposure group was compared to the lowest group an odds ratios of 1.62 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.99 - 2.65 ) was observed for ozone in the second trimester and 1.58 ( 95 % CI 1.06 - 2.35 ) for NOx in the third trimester.
25880886,Conclusion : This study indicates that living in an area with elevated levels of air pollution during pregnancy may be a risk factor for offspring T1D.
27686710,Background : The large intra-patient variability in type 1 diabetic patients dramatically reduces the ability to achieve adequate blood glucose control.
27686710,"A novel methodology to identify different blood glucose dynamics profiles will allow therapies to be more accurate and tailored according to patient 's conditions and to the situations faced by patients ( exercise , week - ends , holidays , menstruation , etc )."
27686710,Materials and methods : A clustering methodology based on the normalized compression distance is applied to identify different profiles for diabetic patients.
27686710,"First , the methodology is validated using "" in silico "" data from 10 patients in 3 different scenarios : days without exercise , poor controlled exercise days and days with well - controlled exercise."
27686710,"Second , we perform a series of in vivo experiments using data from 10 patients assessing the ability of the proposed methodology in real scenarios."
27686710,Results : In silico experiments show that the methodology is able to identify poor and well - controlled days in theoretical scenarios.
27686710,"In vivo experiments present meaningful profiles for working days , bank days and other situations , where different insulin requirements were detected."
27686710,Conclusions : A tool for profiling blood glucose dynamics of patients can be implemented in a short term to enhance existing analysis platforms using combined CGM - CSII systems.
27686710,"Besides coping with the information overload , the tool will assist physicians to adjust and improve insulin therapy and patients in the self - management of the disease."
9877034,Reduced height as a consequence of type - I - diabetes mellitus in childhood has been reported in many studies.
9877034,"However , it is still debated whether good metabolic control can normalize the growth rate."
9877034,"A total of 436 children ( 204 boys , 232 girls , mean age at diagnosis of diabetes 8.2 + / - 0.2 years ) were followed at our outpatient diabetes centre."
9877034,"Z - scores for height were evaluated in relation to duration of diabetes , age at onset and long - term metabolic control."
9877034,"At diagnosis , height in children with diabetes was significantly above the reference population ( +0.43 + / - 0.09 )."
9877034,Standardized height decreased during the subsequent course of diabetes.
9877034,"This likely represents a delay of growth , as the final height ( chronological age > 18 years , n = 144 ) was +0.27 + / - 0.09."
9877034,Growth reduction was more pronounced in patients diagnosed before the onset of puberty and final height in patients with a prepubertal onset of diabetes was significantly lower ( +0.10 + / - 0.13 ) compared to patients with a pubertal / postpubertal onset ( +0.52 + / - 0.14 ).
9877034,"Among patients with a prepubertal onset , the subgroup with "" poor "" metabolic control ( long - term median HbA ( Ic ) > 7 % ) lost significantly more height compared to patients with "" good "" metabolic control."
9877034,"Conclusion : Despite modern treatment regimens , reduced longitudinal growth can still be demonstrated in type - I diabetes."
9877034,This parameter therefore provides a valuable endpoint for quality control in paediatric diabetology.
28640151,Rationale : A hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ( HHS ) is a rare presentation of a hyperglycemic crisis in children with diabetes mellitus.
28640151,"As this condition can be fatal and has high morbidity , early recognition and proper management are necessary for a better outcome."
28640151,"Here , we report a rare case of HHS as the first presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) in a 7 - year - old girl."
28640151,Patient concerns : The patient was admitted due to polyuria and weight loss in the past few days.
28640151,The initial blood glucose level was 1167mg / dL.
28640151,"Diagnoses : On the basis of clinical manifestations and laboratory results , she was diagnosed with T1DM and HHS."
28640151,Interventions : Treatment was started with intravenous fluid and regular insulin.
28640151,Outcomes : She was discharged without any complications related to HHS and is being followed up in the outpatient clinic with split insulin therapy.
28640151,"Lessons : As the incidence of T1DM is increasing , emergency physicians and pediatricians should be aware of HHS to make an early diagnosis for appropriate management , as it can be complicated in young children with T1DM."
23612534,Objective : To evaluate the effect of intensive art therapy in youth with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ).
23612534,Methods : A retrospective report of the characteristics and outcomes of all patients who were offered to receive individual art therapy sessions because of behavioral difficulties.
23612534,Results : The study population included 29 participants.
23612534,The main behavioral difficulties were needle phobia and lack of compliance with nutritional recommendations or with insulin administration.
23612534,"The intervention group included 16 patients , with a mean age of 9.3 ± 2.5 years , average intervention length of 0.77 ± 0.41 years , and long - term data of 2.27 ± 1.13 years."
23612534,"The control group included 13 patients , with a mean age of 9.3 ± 3.4 years."
23612534,Improvement was observed in 56 % of the case group and in 23 % of the control group.
23612534,"Art therapy was associated with a decrease in hemoglobin A1c in the intervention group compared with a similar control group ( - 0.79 % , ± 0.24 % ; r = 0.17 , p = 0.025 )."
23612534,Conclusions : The addition of intensive art therapy for poorly controlled youth with T1DM may improve their glycemic control.
24344989,"Type one diabetes ( T1D ) seems a well - defined disease , but its classification may be difficult."
24344989,Evidence is weak that an autoimmune process with insulitis causes loss of the beta cells in all patients.
24344989,"Some scientists propose that it may be caused by a virus , increased hygiene or the early introduction of cow 's milk or gluten , while views about the nerve supply , vascular function and the beta cells own role tend to be disregarded."
24344989,Immune interventions have had limited success.
24344989,"There are differences , but also similarities , between T1D and type 2 diabetes ( T2D )."
24344989,Conclusion : Several views on T1D have become so widely accepted that they may actually hamper progress into the true cause of this disease.
24344989,"Research on T1D needs to be carried out with an open mind , and clinicians might be wise to recommend a lifestyle that aims to decrease both the risk of T1D and T2D."
15962920,Diabetes and depression have become increasingly linked.
15962920,The incidence of depression in the adolescent diabetic population is especially concerning.
15962920,The purpose of this article is to raise awareness of the association between diabetes and depression particularly in the adolescent population.
15962920,It also discusses treatment techniques for the same population.
15962920,Several treatment techniques have proved successful in this population.
15962920,Psychiatric nurse practitioners and advanced practiced nurses are poised to implement these treatments and interventions.
26994852,OBJECTIVE : To determine how between - and within - person variability in perceived sleep quality were associated with adolescent diabetes management.
26994852,"Methods : A total of 236 older adolescents with type 1 diabetes reported daily for 2 weeks on sleep quality , self - regulatory failures , frequency of blood glucose ( BG ) checks , and BG values."
26994852,"Average , inconsistent , and daily deviations in sleep quality were examined."
26994852,RESULTS : Hierarchical linear models indicated that poorer average and worse daily perceived sleep quality ( compared with one 's average ) was each associated with more self - regulatory failures.
26994852,Sleep quality was not associated with frequency of BG checking.
26994852,Poorer average sleep quality was related to greater risk of high BG.
26994852,"Furthermore , inconsistent and daily deviations in sleep quality interacted to predict higher BG , with more consistent sleepers benefitting more from a night of high - quality sleep."
26994852,"CONCLUSIONS : Good , consistent sleep quality during late adolescence may benefit diabetes management by reducing self - regulatory failures and risk of high BG."
28318073,"Background : Management of diabetes is demanding and requires efficient cognitive skills , especially in the domain of executive functioning."
28318073,"However , the impact of impaired executive functions on diabetes control has been studied to a limited extent."
28318073,The aim of the study is to investigate the association between executive problems and diabetes control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
28318073,"Materials and methods : Two hundred and forty - one of 477 ( 51 % ) of 12 - to 18 - year - old adolescents , with a diabetes duration of > 2 years in Stockholm , Uppsala , and Jönköping participated."
28318073,"Parents and adolescents completed questionnaires , including Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function ( BRIEF ) , Attention - Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) - Rating Scale ( ADHD - RS ) and demographic background factors."
28318073,"Diabetes - related data were collected from the Swedish Childhood Diabetes Registry , SWEDIABKIDS."
28318073,"Self - rated and parent - rated executive problems were analyzed with regard to gender , glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , frequency of outpatient visits , and physical activity , using chi - square tests or Fisher 's test , where P - values < .05 were considered significant."
28318073,"Furthermore , adjusted logistic regressions were performed with executive problems as independent variable."
28318073,"Results : Executive problems , according to BRIEF and / or ADHD - RS were for both genders associated with mean HbA1c > 70 mmol / mol ( patient rating P = .000 , parent rating P = .017 ) , a large number of outpatient visits ( parent rating P = .015 ) , and low physical activity ( patient rating P = .000 , parent rating P = .025 )."
28318073,"Self - rated executive problems were more prevalent in girls ( P = .032 ) , while parents reported these problems to a larger extent in boys ( P = .028 )."
28318073,Conclusion : Executive problems are related to poor metabolic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
28318073,Patients with executive problems need to be recognized by the diabetes team and the diabetes care should be organized to provide adequate support for these patients.
23807601,"Purpose of review : Above 60 non-HLA genes have been associated with T1D , many of which are immune - related genes."
23807601,One challenge following identification of these genes is finding causative connections between risk alleles and disease.
23807601,Phenotypes linked to T1D - associated genetic variants are beginning to help us better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying T1D.
23807601,Recent findings : The list of immune - related genes with T1D - associated polymorphisms will be reviewed and cellular phenotypes correlating with these variants will be described highlighting recent finding from variants in the PTPN22 gene and genes encoding proteins in theIL - 2 / IL2R signaling pathway.
23807601,"Summary : Building from extensive genome - wide association studies , we are discovering cellular and molecular phenotypes that may help unravel the underlying causes of T1D."
30259209,Purpose of review : To explore the impact of age on type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) pathogenesis.
30259209,Recent findings : Children progress more rapidly from autoantibody positivity to T1D and have lower C - peptide levels compared to adults.
30259209,"In histological analysis of post-mortem pancreata , younger age of diagnosis is associated with reduced numbers of insulin containing islets and a hyper - immune CD20hi infiltrate."
30259209,"Moreover compared to adults , children exhibit decreased immune regulatory function and increased engagement and trafficking of autoreactive CD8 + T cells , and age - related differences in β cell vulnerability may also contribute to the more aggressive immune phenotype observed in children."
30259209,"To account for some of these differences , HLA and non-HLA genetic loci that influence multiple disease characteristics , including age of onset , are being increasingly characterized."
30259209,"The exception of T1D as an autoimmune disease more prevalent in children than adults results from a combination of immune , metabolic , and genetic factors."
30259209,Age - related differences in T1D pathology have important implications for better tailoring of immunotherapies.
32168173,Background : Type 1 diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disease during infancy and adolescence.
32168173,Diabetes causes serious coping problems during adolescence because of the need for continuous observation and because of diabetes - related complications.
32168173,"Thus , adolescents must adapt to and effectively manage their diabetes."
32168173,Purpose : This study was designed to determine the perceived barriers to home care in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes using the Health Promotion Model.
32168173,Methods : Eighteen adolescents were selected from the qualified patients who applied to a diabetes polyclinic at a training and research hospital in western Turkey.
32168173,Interview questions were created based on the Health Promotion Model.
32168173,A phenomenological analysis of the data was conducted using the content analysis method.
32168173,"Results : The barriers that participants identified as negatively impacting their ability to manage their disease effectively were categorized into the three themes of "" negative feelings about having diabetes , "" "" personal barriers , "" and "" environmental barriers ."""
32168173,"The barriers identified included school , friends , family , fear of complications , lack of information , and personal characteristics , among others."
32168173,Conclusions / implications for practice : This qualitative study enables us to understand what patients feel because the participants explained their difficulties in managing their disease and in maintaining metabolic control.
32168173,The findings provide an understanding of the subjective experiences of adolescent patients with diabetes.

17667707,Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is an organ - specific autoimmune disease caused by altered immune tolerance to specific proteins leading to a selective destruction of insulin - producing beta cells in genetically predisposed individuals.
17667707,"T1D is likely to be triggered by environmental factors , including virus infections in genetically predisposed individuals."
17667707,"Rotaviruses are the main cause of severe diarrhea among children worldwide , but they seem to have a role also in T1D induction."
17667707,Epidemiological data may be consistent with a similar hypothesis.
17667707,"Mechanisms hypothesized include molecular mimicry , bystander activation ( with or without epitope spreading ) , and viral persistence."
17667707,In this review the authors analyze the factors accounting for rotavirus ability to prime islet autoimmunity and cause T1D.
17667707,A thorough comprehension of their potential pathogenetic mechanisms may allow preventive strategies to be designed.
19502978,"Purpose of review : Although studies of pancreata from type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) patients largely fell dormant for a period of decades , research efforts have recently been ' rekindled ' in this area to address , using modern techniques , many unanswered questions related to the pathogenesis of this disease."
19502978,"Recent findings : As historically noted , a pancreatic infiltrate commonly referred to as ' insulitis ' is present at the symptomatic onset of T1D."
19502978,Recent studies have further characterized this infiltrate both in terms of its cellular composition as well as the mechanisms that likely underlie beta cell death in T1D.
19502978,"In addition , the notion that the pancreas from T1D patients is completely devoid of insulin producing cells years after the onset of disease has been challenged , whereas the concepts of whether beta cell regeneration or replication are present have also been subject to much debate."
19502978,Novel concepts regarding the rate and degree of beta cell loss throughout the natural history of the disease have also been put forward to aid in explaining the disorder 's pathogenesis.
19502978,"Summary : Although answers to many long - standing questions in T1D have recently been addressed , perhaps the main finding has been one supporting a disease of remarkable heterogeneity."
19502978,"However , additional lessons remain to be learned from the pancreas in T1D."
19502978,"Hence , attempts aimed at organizing the scientific community to address these issues are ongoing , particularly those from collaborative efforts , including the Belgium Organ Donor Consortium and the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes ( nPOD )."
28419661,Background : To compare the impact of cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) with non-directive supportive counselling ( NDC ) on glycaemic control and psychological well - being in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ).
28419661,"Materials and methods : Participants aged 11 to 16 years with T1DM ( duration ≥ 1 year ) from 4 UK - based paediatric diabetes centres were randomised to receive either 6 weekly sessions of 1 - to - 1 CBT ( n = 43 ) or NDC ( n = 42 ) , with 2 further sessions at 6 and 12 months."
28419661,Follow - up continued for 12 months postintervention.
28419661,Outcome measures included glycated haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) and psychological scores.
28419661,Results : The HbA1c levels were available in 33 patients in each group for analysis.
28419661,Between group difference of the overall changes in HbA1c across the study period was statically significant ( P = .018 ).
28419661,"Geometric mean ( range ) HbA1c in the NDC group deteriorated from 68 ( 46 - 113 ) to 78 ( 48 - 128 ) mmol / mol ( ie , 8.4 [ 6.4 - 12.5 ] % to 9.3 [ 6.5 - 13.9 ] % ; P = .001 ) , but was maintained in the CBT group from 72 ( 46 - 129 ) to 73 ( 51 - 128 ) mmol / mol ( P = .51 ) ( ie , 8.7 [ 6.4 - 14 ] % to 8.9 [ 6.8 - 13.9 ] % )."
28419661,"More patients who have undergone CBT showed an improved or maintained HbA1c levels at 24 months ( 62.5 % vs 35.5 % , P = .032 )."
28419661,"Patients offered CBT with depressive scores in the lowest tertile ( least depressive symptoms ) showed improvement in HbA1c over time from 70 ( 46 - 102 ) to 67 ( 57 - 87 ) mmol / mol ( P = .041 ) ( ie , 8.6 [ 6.4 - 11.5 ] % to 8.3 [ 7.4 - 10.1 ] % ) , but not in the NDC group."
28419661,The CBT showed borderline improvements in Children 's Health Locus of Control ( internal ) scores over time compared with NDC ( P = .05 ).
28419661,The self - efficacy score showed significant improvement in both CBT ( P < .001 ) and NDC ( P = .03 ) groups over time.
28419661,Conclusions : CBT demonstrated better maintenance of glycaemic control compared with NDC.
12428285,A relationship between enteric microbiocenosis and severity of type 1 diabetes mellitus was detected.
12428285,Microbiological analysis showed II - IV degree dysbacteriosis in all diabetic children.
12428285,"Long - term therapy with probiotics aimed at eradication of opportunistic microflora resulted in recovery of microbiocenosis , which was paralleled by improvement of the clinical status , regression of complications in children who were ill for a long time , and prevention of complications in children with newly detected diabetes."
12428285,These results indicate the leading role of chronic enteric toxic infectious process in the development of complications of type 1 diabetes.
12428285,The significance of infection in the pathogenesis of other noninfectious diseases in man is discussed.
10433102,"Despite recent progress in immunology and genetics , the causes of type 1 diabetes remain unknown."
10433102,Prevention of autoimmune diseases through immunomodulation or gene therapy has not yet been successful in humans.
10433102,"In contrast , some autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease , rheumatic fever , and congenital rubella induced diabetes can be avoided through modification of environmental factors."
10433102,Candidate environmental causes of type 1 diabetes are now being characterized in cohort studies and clinical trials.
10433102,"An alternative approach to prevention of type 1 diabetes may include a "" vaccination "" in early childhood to induce tolerance to critical autoantigen ( s )."
10433102,This paper reviews the status of current diabetes prevention trials in humans and selected new interventions that are being tested in animal models.
10433102,We estimate the cost of public health implementation of selected screening and intervention scenarios.
10433102,"The ethical , logistic , and funding issues underlying these scenarios are discussed."
30115719,Paediatric cataracts can present a diagnostic dilemma to ophthalmologists.
30115719,Next - generation DNA sequencing ( NGS ) has been promoted as a tool to expedite the diagnosis of an underlying cause in such cases .1 The authors present an unusual case of bilateral cataracts in an 11 - year - old girl as the first presenting feature of new type 1 diabetes mellitus.
30115719,Prompt diagnosis and subsequent management of this potentially life - threatening condition were achieved through careful history taking and targeted biochemical testing.
30115719,The authors feel this case highlights the significance of simple measures such as thorough history taking in the assessment of paediatric cataracts.
30115719,It is important that these skills are not lost through the availability of clinical tools such as NGS.
29083332,"Background : Diabetes mellitus , including type 1 is a global public health problem among the young persons."
29083332,"While public health campaign and screening program is a potential strategy , but communication skills , knowledge and opinion of the healthcare personnel are indicated as variables that can impact patient 's education , which will lead to better outcome of care."
29083332,"Thus , in designing or planning a program for public health , workforce development considers opinion and behavioural change wheel of prospective personnel."
29083332,Objective : The purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate if a university academic department has the behavioural change wheel to function as workforce infrastructure for an envisioned program.
29083332,"Method : Survey of knowledge , attitude and practice ( KAP ) of a university community regarding diabetes type 1 was performed."
29083332,"The KAP were translated into behavioural change wheel comprising capacity , motivation and opportunity ( CMO )."
29083332,Results : There are baseline indications of the behavioural change wheel potential of the public health department to run a T1D screening program.
29083332,The number of participants who knew someone with T1D was significantly higher than the subgroup with no such knowledge ( p < 0.0004 ) and this improved when age factor is considered ( p < 0.00005 ).
29083332,"Conclusion : While the public health department of a university community has the behavioural change wheel or CMO to develop a workforce infrastructure for T1D screening program , the experience that comes with age of lecturers will be an important factor to enable such program to succeed."
16898876,The reporting of the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial in 1993 has led to a major reappraisal of management practices and outcomes in type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents.
16898876,"A considerable body of outcome data has been generated from Australia in this post-Diabetes Control and Complications Trial era relating to incidence , metabolic control , growth , hypoglycaemia , microvascular and macrovascular complications , cognition , behaviour and quality of life."
16898876,These data are important in planning future management strategies and resource allocation and as a basis for future research.
26165784,Introduction : The current study focuses on parents ' sense of coherence and its association to their resolution of the child 's disease.
26165784,Methods : We conducted a study of 122 mothers and fathers of adolescents who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes to assess their SOC and their reactions to their child 's diagnosis.
26165784,Results : A significant difference was found in SOC between parents who have come to terms with their child 's disease and parents who have not.
26165784,Conclusion : Findings may testify to the importance of parents ' state of mind as a resource for reconstructing their caregiving system.
12762954,The incidence of type 1 diabetes continues to increase worldwide.
12762954,"Despite major strides in the daily care of patients with the disease , the patients ' contribution to overall morbidity and mortality statistics and health care economic burden to society is disproportionately large because of the high rate of microvascular and macrovascular complications."
12762954,The quest for prevention of type 1 diabetes has been made feasible by the unraveling of the immunogenetics of the disease and the identification of at - risk subjects by an enhanced understanding of the natural history of the prediabetic period.
12762954,"A combination of immunologic , metabolic , and genetic markers can be used to accurately predict the disease in higher - risk relatives and the general population."
12762954,"This has enabled initiation of worldwide trials ( Diabetes Prevention Trial - Type 1 , European Nicotinamide Diabetes Intervention Trial , and Trial to Prevent Diabetes in Genetically at Risk ) aimed at the prevention of the disease."
12762954,Various promising agents are being considered for use in different at - risk populations in the near future.
24987991,We present a thin toddler whose initial presentation with type 1 diabetes was hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome without diabetic ketoacidosis after ingestion of copious quantities of high - sugar beverages.
24987991,Increasing consumption of high - sugar beverages may make this presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus more common.
24987991,"Emergency care physicians must be aware of this potential clinical constellation in the very young , as management differs significantly from that accepted for diabetic ketoacidosis in children."
20215458,"Objective : The primary aim of the study was to investigate the relationship among executive functioning , diabetes treatment adherence , and glycemic control."
20215458,Research design and methods : Two hundred and thirty - five children with type 1 diabetes and their primary caregivers were administered the Diabetes Self - Management Profile to assess treatment adherence.
20215458,Executive functioning was measured using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning and glycemic control was based on A1C.
20215458,Results : Structural equation modeling indicated that a model in which treatment adherence mediated the relationship between executive functioning and glycemic control best fit the data.
20215458,All paths were significant at P < 0.01.
20215458,"Conclusions : These results indicate that executive functioning skills ( e.g. , planning , problem - solving , organization , and working memory ) were related to adherence , which was related to diabetes control."
20215458,Executive functioning may be helpful to assess in ongoing clinical management of type 1 diabetes.
20685342,"Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes involves the activation of autoimmune T cells , consequent homing of activated lymphocytes to the pancreatic islets and ensuing destruction of insulin - producing b cells."
20685342,Interaction between activated lymphocytes and endothelial cells in the islets is the hallmark of the homing process.
20685342,"Initial adhesion , firm adhesion and diapedesis of lymphocytes are the three crucial steps involved in the homing process."
20685342,"Cell - surface receptors including integrins , selectins and hyaluronate receptor CD44 mediate the initial steps of homing."
20685342,Diapedesis relies on a series of proteolytic events mediated by matrix metalloproteinases.
20685342,"Here , molecular mechanisms governing transendothelial migration of the diabetogenic effector cells are discussed and resulting pharmacological strategies are considered."
12502506,Type 1 diabetes is associated with chronic hyperglycemia and exposure to intermittent severe hypoglycemia.
12502506,The long - term cerebral effects of these consequences of diabetes are ill defined.
12502506,"In this study , the history of preceding severe hypoglycemia and the presence of background retinopathy were examined in relation to cognitive ability ( neuropsychological test battery ) and brain structure ( magnetic resonance imaging ) in a cross-sectional evaluation of 74 young people with type 1 diabetes."
12502506,Participants differed by their severe hypoglycemia exposure and degree of diabetic retinopathy and none had previous neuropsychological pathology.
12502506,Severe hypoglycemia did not influence cognitive ability or brain structure.
12502506,"Background diabetic retinopathy was associated with small focal white - matter hyperintensities in the basal ganglia ( 33.3 vs. 4.7 % , after correction for age , P = 0.005 ) and significant cognitive disadvantage , affecting fluid intelligence ( P = 0.008 , Eta ( 2 ) = 0.14 ) , information processing ( P = 0.001 , Eta ( 2 ) = 0.22 ) , and attention and concentration ability ( P = 0.03 , Eta ( 2 ) = 0.09 )."
12502506,"In conclusion , recurrent exposure to severe hypoglycemia alone in young people with type 1 diabetes had no detrimental impact on brain structure or function over the duration of diabetes examined."
12502506,Chronic hyperglycemia ( inferred by the presence of background diabetic retinopathy ) may affect brain structure and function.
15963965,"Despite a large body of evidence describing associations between viruses and the development of type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) in genetically prone individuals , clearly defining causative infectious agents has not been successful."
15963965,A likely explanation is that the link between infections and autoimmunity is more multifaceted than we initially assumed.
15963965,"Viral footprints might be hard to detect systemically or in the target organ once autoimmunity has been initiated , and several infections might have to act in concert to precipitate clinical autoimmunity."
15963965,"Furthermore , cells cross-reactive between viral and self - antigens might express low avidity T cell receptors and only be present transiently in the blood of affected individuals."
15963965,"In addition , there are two new observations from animal models that we should take into account at this point : first , viral infections alone might not be able to induce disease in the absence of other inflammatory factors ( supporting the "" fertile field hypothesis "" [ M.G. von Herrath et al. , Microorganisms and autoimmunity : making the barren field fertile?"
15963965,Nat.
15963965,Rev. Microbiol.
15963965,"1 ( 2003 ) 151 - 157 , ] )."
15963965,"Second , increasing evidence indicates that viruses can play a role in preventing rather than enhancing T1D development ( supporting the "" hygiene hypothesis "" [ J.F. Bach , Protective role of infections and vaccinations on autoimmune diseases."
15963965,J. Autoimmun.
15963965,16 ( 2001 ) 347 - 353 ] ).
15963965,"In this article we will present an overview of the early events and requirements that could account for T1D predisposition and development , and explain how these can be modulated by viral infections."
15963965,"Focusing on coxsackie B and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections , we will discuss new data that can hopefully help us understand how virus - induced inflammation can positively or negatively affect the clinical outcome of islet - autoimmunity and T1D."
12908509,Immune - based interventions to treat or prevent autoimmune disorders are opening up entirely novel therapeutic avenues.
12908509,"Presently , systemic immune modulators such as antibodies to cytokines or cell - surface molecules ( i.e. , costimulators ) are undergoing clinical testing or are already in use."
12908509,The next generation of interventions will function in an antigen - specific way.
12908509,"These strategies are more difficult to design , because successful immunization or vaccination has to be monitored on an individual basis and dose / route / timing considerations play an essential role."
12908509,Both will be discussed in this chapter and suitable combinatorial approaches will be suggested.
26840670,Objective : To compare lipid parameters between diabetics and controls and to study association between metabolic control and lipid profile.
26840670,"Methods : Lipid profile and HbA1c were measured ( n = 80 , 39 boys ) in diabetic children [ age 10.7 ( 3.4 ) y ] and 54 controls , tests repeated after 1 year ( in 45 diabetics )."
26840670,"Results : Diabetic children had higher mean ( SD ) LDL - C [ 95.3 ( 27.7 ) vs 84.5 ( 26.4 ) mg / dL ] , lower HDL - C [ 48.2 ( 13.1 ) vs 53.1 ( 11.9 ) mg / dl ]."
26840670,Moderate physical activity ( P = 0.014 ) protected against high LDL - C levels.
26840670,HbA1c ( P = 0.00 ) predicted total and LDL - C levels.
26840670,"At 1 year , 63 % showed reduced LDL - C with improving HbA1c ; 72 % showed increased LDL - C with deteriorated HbA1c."
26840670,Conclusion : Improving metabolic control is cardinal to reduce cardiometabolic risk ; physical activity is beneficial.
17659065,Objective : We sought to examine prospectively patterns of clinical and psychosocial outcomes during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood in a cohort initiating intensive therapy after the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial.
17659065,"Research design and methods : We conducted a prospective , descriptive analysis of data from a randomized intervention study with 117 adolescents ( 45 males and 72 females , mean age at entry = 14.4 + / - 2.0 yr , mean diabetes duration at entry = 5.7 + / - 3.7 yr ) recruited from a large pediatric diabetes clinic."
17659065,"Data were collected for each subject over periods of up to 5 yr at 6 - month intervals using measures of depressive symptoms , quality of life , and metabolic control , with chart review for prevalence of diabetes complications."
17659065,Results : Metabolic control worsens during adolescence but returns to early adolescent levels in young adulthood.
17659065,"The negative impact of diabetes on quality of life , disease - related worries , and life satisfaction did not change significantly with age."
17659065,These results did not vary with treatment group or gender.
17659065,Participants who showed high levels of depressive symptoms as adolescents were somewhat more likely to be depressed when older.
17659065,"Despite relatively long duration of diabetes , relatively few complications were observed in young adulthood."
17659065,Conclusions : These data suggest that youth who begin intensive treatment as adolescents generally have good metabolic and psychosocial outcomes as young adults.
17659065,"However , those who have high levels of depressive symptoms in adolescence tend to continue to have such symptoms in early adulthood."
16932263,Animal models and human studies have provided strong evidence that the immune response that causes type 1A diabetes is initiated against a limited array of antigens but acquires breadth and depth until beta - cell mass has been critically compromised.
16932263,"Two recent trials confirmed the ability to identify relatives at risk for development of diabetes , but were unsuccessful in preventing disease."
16932263,"Treatment of at - risk individuals with oral insulin , which is postulated to be an antigen in the disease , did however show efficacy in a subgroup of these subjects , suggesting that antigen - specific prevention approaches might be successful in the right group of subjects at the right time."
16932263,Earlier trials showed that the natural progression of disease can be altered with conventional immune suppression but these approaches have been supplanted by tolerance - induction strategies.
16932263,Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies have shown efficacy in preventing the loss of insulin production over the first 2 years of disease without chronic immune suppression.
16932263,"The mechanisms are novel , and appear to involve induction of immune regulation by the monoclonal antibody."
16932263,"Ultimately , preservation and even improvement in beta - cell mass is the goal of therapy."
16932263,The means needed to achieve this will depend on the timing and mechanisms of the immune intervention and might require combinations of agents.
12116171,"The fast increase in the incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) that can not be explained by changes in the genetic susceptibility , led us to look for environmental causes."
12116171,"To test the hypothesis that the initiation of the autoimmune process of childhood T1DM in genetically susceptible subjects begins in the perinatal period by a viral infection , we studied the seasonal variations in the month of birth of several cohorts of patients compared to the general population."
12116171,Population groups with high or low T1DM incidence were analyzed separately by t - test and the Cosinor methods.
12116171,"In areas with populations with a high incidence ( Israeli Jews , Sicily , Sardinia , Slovenia , Germany ) we found that the children ( in Sicily also young adults ) who subsequently developed T1DM , have a higher incidence of births in the summer months than in other seasons of the year , a mirror image of the seasonality of the clinical onset of disease."
12116171,This pattern differed significantly from the seasonality of the total live births in the same populations.
12116171,"In populations with a low T1DM incidence , ( China , Japan and Cuba ) no seasonality of month of birth was found."
12116171,"Similar findings have been reported , from five counties in the U.K. and the Netherlands."
12116171,"It is hypothesized that mothers who become pregnant during the period of yearly viral epidemics transmit to the fetus , either a virus or antiviral antibodies , which determine whether an autoimmune process against the pancreatic beta is initiated or whether the fetus is protected against that process."
15536874,Autoimmune diseases affect 10 % or more of the UK population.
15536874,In organ - specific autoimmune diseases a particular tissue is targeted by the aggressive immune response.
15536874,Type 1 diabetes is due to destruction of insulin - secreting islet cells.
15536874,"Both genetic and environmental factors cause type 1 diabetes and environmental events can operate very early , even in utero."
15536874,The early induction of diabetes - associated autoantibodies and the long prediabetic period means that autoimmune diabetes in children can be predicted by detecting these autoantibodies.
15536874,The purpose of prediction is prevention and initial studies suggest that it is possible to modify the disease process.
15536874,"However , the impact of such therapy on the disease is as yet extremely modest."
17575381,"We report the case of a 59 - year - old woman who developed rapid - onset type 1 diabetes associated with a marked increase in anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody titer ( 317.5 U / ml ) , mild increase in HbA1c level ( 6.8 % ) , diabetic ketoacidosis , and cytomegalovirus enterocolitis."
17575381,"She was a heterozygote for HLA class II DRB1 * 0901 - DQA1 * 03 - DQB1 * 0303 , and she had HLA class I A24 , which may have contributed to the rapid beta cell destruction."
17575381,"Based on the putative molecular mimicry of GAD65 by cytomegalovirus antigen , we hypothesize that the type 1 diabetes in this case was associated with cytomegalovirus infection."
16769387,"Objective : To determine the association among diabetes - related bullying , diabetes self - management , metabolic control , and depression in children and adolescents with type I diabetes ( TID )."
16769387,Study design : Measures of diabetes - related bullying and depression were administered to 167 youth with TID at their regularly scheduled diabetes care visits.
16769387,Parents were administered a clinician - rated index of their child 's diabetes self - management.
16769387,HbA1c levels were assessed.
16769387,Results : Diabetes - related bullying was positively related to HbA1c concentration and negatively related to overall self - management and specifically to adherence to glucose testing and dietary tasks.
16769387,Depressive symptoms partially mediated the relation between diabetes - related bullying and overall self - management.
16769387,"Conclusion : Given the associations between diabetes - related bullying and regimen self - management , the issue of illness - related bullying merits serious attention for pediatricians and school personnel."
23045291,Hospital conditions for children have changed dramatically over the last decades.
23045291,"Until recently , hospitalised children were left without their parents in an environment that was not adapted to children."
23045291,"In the period 1950 - 1980 , hospitalised children did not have a voice."
23045291,The aim of this Norwegian study was to use adult memories of childhood hospitalisation to investigate the influences of the hospital environment on the experiences of children.
23045291,The study had a qualitative design and used a hermeneutic phenomenological approach.
23045291,Twelve adults who were 5 & frac12 ; to 12 years old when they were first hospitalised with type 1 diabetes were interviewed.
23045291,The participants described their hospital stays as representing a life in an adult world.
23045291,They encountered an unfamiliar place where it was challenging to be abandoned in an adult hospital community with a serious and exhausting illness.
23045291,The results underscore the need to incorporate children 's perspectives to achieve a ' child friendly ' environment in the hospital.
23045291,Thirty years later there still may be a tension between the adults ' responsibility to protect children and the children 's own right to participation in decision - making.
23045291,"To understand current practices , it is important to know our historical past."
19672902,The past quarter century has seen a rapid increase in our knowledge about the natural history of autoimmune type 1 diabetes.
19672902,"However , we stand unable to achieve our ultimate goal of preventing or reversing this disease."
19672902,"This viewpoint discusses controversies in current management of type 1 diabetes , the challenges in translating promising studies from mouse models of the disease to humans , hurdles faced in designing optimal prevention and intervention studies , and potential strategies to overcome these obstacles."
14679094,"The Melbourne Prediabetes Family Study , a prospective study of first - degree relatives of people with type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , provided an opportunity to examine late - onset autoimmune diabetes within the context of a family history of T1D."
14679094,"We compared genetic , immunologic , and clinical features in relatives of people with T1D , who developed early - versus late - onset diabetes."
15789936,Objective : The objective of this study was to investigate perceived health and functioning ( PHF ) of patients with type I diabetes mellitus ( DMT1 ) over time and to compare change in perceived PHF with that of a sample of the general population.
15789936,Methods : In a Dutch cohort of 234 patients with DMT1 we assessed PHF over time with two generic instruments : RAND - 36 and EuroQol.
15789936,We applied multilevel modelling to estimate change in PHF over the years 1995 -- 2001.
15789936,We compared change in PHF with change estimated from a comparably aged sample from the general population using a one - sample t - test.
15789936,Results : Patients reported a significant decrease in PHF for most RAND - 36 subscales.
15789936,Mean changes in RAND - 36 scores ranged from -0.09 ( mental health ) to -1.18 per year ( bodily pain ).
15789936,EQ scores decreased significantly as well.
15789936,Patients in the cohort had a faster decrease in three RAND - 36 subscales and EQ - VAS over time than the estimated decrease in the general population.
15789936,Conclusion : This study showed that patients with DMT1 have a faster decrease in PHF over time than comparably aged persons from the general population.
15789936,The generic instruments used in our study were sensitive enough to measure changes in PHF over time in an adult diabetes population.
10495998,"Type I diabetes mellitus results from the genetically predetermined autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta - cells , resulting in gradual , but complete , loss of insulin secretion."
10495998,"There are strong associations with specific HLA haplotypes , but environmental triggers are also required to initiate beta - cell autoimmunity."
10495998,"These could possibly include enteroviral infection , early weaning from breastfeeding , early exposure to cow 's milk antigens , and free radical damage."
10495998,"Once initiated , beta - cell autoimmunity does not always lead to clinical diabetes , suggesting that immunomodulators may be important in the control of beta - cell destruction."
10495998,Current interventions designed to prevent type I diabetes mellitus are based on attempts to alter this immune response and to preserve beta - cell function.
10495998,It is important for the pediatrician to understand the background of these trials and to be able to answer parents ' questions regarding study participation.
3554198,Considerable advances in the understanding of the immune basis of type I diabetes have encouraged trials of a number of forms of immunotherapy.
3554198,Preliminary evidence indicates that cyclosporin ( Sandimmune ) treatment can halt beta cell destruction in about 50 % of patients with newly diagnosed type I diabetes.
3554198,Further studies are necessary to define the toxicity of this and other protocols prior to clinical use.
3554198,"Efforts to define the target antigen in type I diabetes may lead to development of more specific forms of immunotherapy or , possibly , a vaccine."
1557342,Pancreatic hypoplasia is an uncommon developmental defect that has not been well documented in association with type I diabetes mellitus.
1557342,We report the case of a patient with an atypical clinical onset of type I diabetes mellitus who died following pancreas transplantation.
1557342,Autopsy showed the surprising finding of hypoplasia of the native pancreas with other features indicating the concurrence of type I diabetes mellitus.
1557342,These findings lead to speculation about the occurrence and interaction of these two diseases in our patient.
10867717,Four cases of simultaneous manifestation of Type 1 diabetes in two members of the same household are reported.
10867717,"In all cases , a flu - like infection preceded diabetes onset."
10867717,"Surprisingly , despite simultaneous development of insulin dependency , insulin requirements were strikingly different at 3 months in all cases."
10867717,These observations suggest that increased insulin resistance during infection may cause insulin deficiency in individuals with widely varying residual beta cell activity.
3987830,"The distal latencies , motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities , and respiratory heart arrhythmia ( RHA ) were measured in 14 patients with type I diabetes but without clinical signs of polyneuropathy."
3987830,The electroneurographic parameters tended to improve as the HbA1 value decreased.
3987830,The RHA was not affected.
32889433,Purpose : Racial disparities have been shown in outcomes and treatment of children with type 1 diabetes ( T1D ).
32889433,"The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends in insulin pump use among non-Hispanic white ( NHW ) , non-Hispanic black ( NHB ) and Hispanic children attending a large urban diabetes center."
32889433,"This study was a retrospective chart review of insulin pump usage by race ( NHW / NHB ) in 2005 , and race / ethnicity ( NHW / NHB / Hispanic ) in 2011 - 2019."
32889433,"Demographic data ( age , sex , diabetes duration , SES ) and most recent hemoglobin A1c were also abstracted in 2011 - 2019."
32889433,"Results : In 2005 , NHW children were twice as likely to use an insulin pump as NHB children."
32889433,"From 2011 to 2019 , the odds ratio increased to 2.5 for NHW compared to NHB children."
32889433,The odds of Hispanic children using insulin pumps were also higher than NHB.
32889433,"Insurance status ( government versus private ) , a surrogate for SES , had very little influence on these trends , with NHW children consistently more likely than NHB children to be treated with insulin pumps in 2011 , 2013 , 2017 , 2019 ( p < 0.001 )."
32889433,"Conclusions : We have demonstrated that racial disparities in insulin pump use have persisted over the past 15 years , and are not determined by SES."
32889433,This inequity in diabetes treatment may be playing a role in the poorer glycemic control and higher rates of diabetes complications in NHB children.
32889433,Practice implications : Healthcare providers should be cognizant of racial and ethnic disparities in the treatment of children with T1D.
32889433,Standardized treatment protocols may reduce unconscious bias in prescribing.
27664042,"Treatments for autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) are aimed at resetting the immune system , especially its adaptive arm."
27664042,The innate immune system is often ignored in the design of novel immune - based therapies.
27664042,"There is increasing evidence for multiple natural killer ( NK ) subpopulations , but their role is poorly understood in autoimmunity and likely is contributing to the controversial role reported for NKs."
27664042,"In this review , we will summarize NK subsets and their roles in tolerance , autoimmune diabetes , and immunotherapy."
18789598,Bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) has been used to treat autoimmune diseases for many years.
18789598,"Insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ) , also called type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) , is a T cell - mediated autoimmune disease resulting from a selective destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells."
18789598,"Recently , T1D has been a common significant cause of morbidity and mortality."
18789598,"However , whether BMT can be used to treat T1DM is still controversial."
18789598,"During BMT procedure , recipients underwent total body irradiation ( TBI ) and subsequent bone marrow cells ( BMCs ) infusion , in which TBI kills off the most T lymphocytes and BMCs stimulates hematopoiesis and immune reconstitution."
18789598,We suggest that high - dose TBI and BMCs may improve efficiency of BMT therapy in T1DM treatment.
19393195,Infection by various viral and bacterial pathogens has long been proposed as one of the etiologies of autoimmune diabetes.
19393195,"Many theories , ranging from direct cytolysis of pancreatic islet cells to immunological processes such as antigen mimicry and polyclonal lymphocyte activation , tried to explain the epidemiological correlation between infections and diabetes , supported by information from human and animal studies."
19393195,"However , a direct correlation and exact mechanism continue to elude investigators due to scarce and conflicting data."
19393195,"Interestingly , there is also data to support an opposite role for infection in the development of type 1 diabetes , as several pathogens demonstrated a protective effect from this disease."
19393195,"This article reviews the current data available from clinical studies and animal models , while trying to explain the different mechanisms underlying these findings."
6647156,"In recent years research on the pathogenesis of juvenile - onset , insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( now called type I ) has considerably expanded , a development that is documented by an impressive number of conferences and symposia held on this topic every year."
6647156,In the present review the authors will discuss new insights into the etiology of type I diabetes.
6647156,Additional information is available in several recently published reviews.
22548954,Objective : To review prediction of type 1 diabetes mellitus in light of current trials for prevention and novel preclinical therapies.
22548954,Methods : The stages in the development of type 1A diabetes are reviewed and strategies for prevention are discussed.
22548954,"Results : From islet autoantibody testing of random cadaveric donors , it is apparent that approximately one - half million persons in the United States express multiple islet autoantibodies and are in the process of developing type 1A ( immune - mediated ) diabetes."
22548954,It is now possible to predict not only risk for type 1A diabetes but also the approximate age of diabetes onset in children followed up from birth.
22548954,"In animal models , diabetes can be prevented."
22548954,Some of the immunologic therapies effective in animal models are able to delay loss of insulin secretion in humans.
22548954,Conclusions : None of the therapies studied to date in humans can completely arrest progressive loss of insulin secretion resulting from destruction of islet β cells.
22548954,"Nevertheless , current knowledge of pathogenesis ( targeting trimolecular recognition complex : major histocompatibility complex , peptide , T - cell receptor ) and natural history combined with newer diagnostic methods allows accurate diagnosis and has stimulated the search for novel safe and effective preventive therapies."
10496000,"Now that prediction of type I diabetes mellitus has markedly improved , worldwide attempts to prevent the disease are under way ( e.g. , DPT - 1 , ENDIT , and TRIGR )."
10496000,Subjects are being recruited and families of children or parents with diabetes should be informed about the availability of such studies and given the option to participate.
10496000,The creation of a network of study sites or cooperative groups will allow for the implementation of new protocols aimed at preventing the disease.
10496000,The greatest barrier to the prevention of diabetes is the lack of proven effective interventional agents.
10496000,The journey toward prevention of type I diabetes mellitus has only just begun.
26414020,Background : Whether behavioral approaches for self - management programs benefit individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus is unclear.
26414020,"Purpose : To determine the effects of behavioral programs for patients with type 1 diabetes on behavioral , clinical , and health outcomes and to investigate factors that might moderate effect."
26414020,"Data sources : 6 electronic databases ( 1993 to June 2015 ) , trial registries and conference proceedings ( 2011 to 2014 ) , and reference lists."
26414020,"Study selection : 36 prospective , controlled studies involving participants of any age group that compared behavioral programs with usual care , active controls , or other programs."
26414020,Data extraction : One reviewer extracted and another verified data.
26414020,Two reviewers assessed quality and strength of evidence ( SOE ).
26414020,"Data synthesis : Moderate SOE showed reduction in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) at 6 months after the intervention compared with usual care ( mean difference , -0.29 [ 95 % CI , -0.45 to -0.13 ] percentage points ) and compared with active controls ( - 0.44 [ CI , -0.69 to -0.19 ] percentage points )."
26414020,"At the end of the intervention and 12 - month follow - up or longer , there were no statistically significant differences in HbA1c ( low SOE ) for comparisons with usual care or active control."
26414020,"Compared with usual care , generic quality of life at program completion did not differ ( moderate SOE )."
26414020,Other outcomes had low or insufficient SOE.
26414020,"Adults appeared to benefit more for glycemic control at program completion ( - 0.28 [ CI , -0.57 to 0.01 ] percentage points ) than did youth ( - 0.12 [ CI , -0.43 to 0.19 ] percentage points )."
26414020,Program intensity appeared not to influence effectiveness ; some individual delivery appears beneficial.
26414020,Limitations : All studies had medium or high risk of bias.
26414020,There was scarce evidence for many outcomes.
26414020,"Conclusion : Behavioral programs for type 1 diabetes offer some benefit for glycemic control , at least at short - term follow - up , but improvement for other outcomes has not been shown."

8281732,Quality of life and metabolic control were examined in 74 adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus in 1988.
8281732,Sixty - six of the persons were followed up in 1990 with the aim of studying more closely the subgroup that showed a ' major ' discrepancy between ' retrospective ' and ' prospective ' quality of life change ratings.
8281732,' Prospective ' quality of life change was defined as the difference in assessed quality of life status between 1990 and 1988.
8281732,' Retrospective ' quality of life change was assessed directly by subjects in 1990 covering the same time period.
8281732,"Data on quality of life , well - being , sociodemographics and metabolic control were collected on both occasions."
8281732,Recent life - change events and long - term complications were also recorded in 1990.
8281732,"Subjects with ' major ' discrepancy reported greater retrospective quality of life improvement , higher quality of life , and greater well - being , as well as lesser occurrence of negative and greater occurrence of positive recent life - change events , than did those with ' minor ' discrepancy , despite their exhibiting poorer metabolic control and a higher prevalence of incipient nephropathy."
8281732,The results are discussed in terms of possible coping and defence strategies.
22494609,The seemingly inexorable decline in insulin independence after islet transplant alone ( ITA ) has raised concern about its clinical utility.
22494609,We hypothesized that induction immunosuppression therapy determines durability of insulin independence.
22494609,We analyzed the proportion of insulin - independent patients following final islet infusion in four groups of ITA recipients according to induction immunotherapy : University of Minnesota recipients given FcR nonbinding anti-CD3 antibody alone or T cell depleting antibodies ( TCDAb ) and TNF - α inhibition ( TNF - α - i ) ( group 1 ; n = 29 ) ; recipients reported to the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry ( CITR ) given TCDAb + TNF - α - i ( group 2 ; n = 20 ) ; CITR recipients given TCDAb without TNF - α - i ( group 3 ; n = 43 ) ; and CITR recipients given IL - 2 receptor antibodies ( IL - 2RAb ) alone ( group 4 ; n = 177 ).
22494609,Results were compared with outcomes in pancreas transplant alone ( PTA ) recipients reported to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients ( group 5 ; n = 677 ).
22494609,The 5 - year insulin independence rates in group 1 ( 50 % ) and group 2 ( 50 % ) were comparable to outcomes in PTA ( group 5 : 52 % ; p >> 0.05 ) but significantly higher than in group 3 ( 0 % ; p = 0.001 ) and group 4 ( 20 % ; p = 0.02 ).
22494609,"Induction immunosuppression was significantly associated with 5 - year insulin independence ( p = 0.03 ) , regardless of maintenance immunosuppression or other factors."
22494609,"These findings support potential for long - term insulin independence after ITA using potent induction therapy , with anti-CD3 Ab or TCDAb + TNF - α -i."
14710777,"Objective : To explore the relationship between self - efficacy , family environment ( cohesion and organization ) and metabolic control."
14710777,Research design and methods : A total of 100 adolescents with diabetes were assessed on a single occasion.
14710777,"Eligibility criteria were an age range of 11 - 18 yr , diagnosis of type 1 diabetes of at least 1 yr duration , and ability to complete the questionnaire unaided."
14710777,Adolescents completed self - efficacy and family environment questionnaires.
14710777,Metabolic control was assessed by HbA1c.
14710777,Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Version 10.0.
14710777,Independent paired t - tests and Pearson 's correlation coefficient were used as test methods.
14710777,"Results : Boys and girls were comparable on self - efficacy , and self - efficacy scores were quite satisfactory for both boys and girls."
14710777,"There was a significant positive correlation between self - efficacy and family cohesion in girls , but self - efficacy was not related to the family environment ( cohesion and organization ) and metabolic control in the total sample."
14710777,"Conclusion : In the present study , there was no relationship between self - efficacy , family environment , and metabolic control in the total sample , but in girls , self - efficacy and family cohesion was positively correlated."
9642624,"Much of our present knowledge concerning the etiopathogenesis , treatment and prevention of human diabetes would never have been acquired without the study of animal models of diabetes."
9642624,"The main models of IDDM may be divided into two groups : induced ( through pancreatectomy , chemicals such as alloxan and streptozotocin , viruses and others ) and spontaneous ( mainly using BB rats and NOD mice )."
9642624,"The latter , at different ages , develop a diabetic syndrome , with clinical characteristics , genetics and immunology that are very similar to the human disease."
9642624,Among the more significant differences are lymphopenia ( in BB rats ) and the predominance of diabetes in females ( in NOD mice ).
9642624,Studies aimed at preventing IDDM have advanced by leaps and bounds by using the two spontaneous models.
9642624,"These include various methods such as genomic modification , an influence over some environmental agents , immunosuppression , immunotherapy , immunomodulation and tolerance induction as well as protection of the beta - cell from autoimmune attack."
9642624,The conclusions drawn from animal experiments have allowed some human trials to be carried out with encouraging results.
30918186,"The patient was a 71 - year - old woman with aquaporin -4-antibody positive neuromyelitis optica ( NMO ) , with no history of diabetes."
30918186,"On admission , although she showed an extremely elevated plasma glucose level ( 1,080 mg / dL ) , her hemoglobin A1c level was low ( 7.1 % ) , which indicated the rapid progression of diabetes."
30918186,"She also showed ketoacidosis and had a human leukocyte antigen haplotype , DRB1 * 09:01 - DQB1 * 03:03 associated with Fulminant type 1 diabetes ( FT1D )."
30918186,"Based on these results , the patient was diagnosed with FT1D."
30918186,"We herein describe the first reported case of a patient with FT1D with NMO , which raises the possibility that T - cell - mediated autoimmunity is involved in the pathogenesis of both FT1D and NMO."
26062518,"Background : A different clinical presentation of type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) could be supposed in children belonging to different ethnicities , with or without family history of autoimmunity."
26062518,Objective : This study investigates the effect of ethnicity and family history of T1DM on clinical characteristics at presentation in a group of T1DM children.
26062518,"Methods : One hundred ninety - six T1DM children < 18 years , consecutively diagnosed during the years 2011 - 2014 , were studied including 91 % of Caucasians of Italian ancestry and 9 % of non-Caucasian origin."
26062518,"Results : Children with 1st or 2nd degree relatives affected by T1DM were younger at disease onset ( p = 0.005 ) and showed lower HbA1C levels ( p = 0.002 ) , and higher IAA levels ( p = 0.01 )."
26062518,"Non-Caucasian children were younger at disease onset ( p = 0.029 ) , and showed more severe hyperglycemia ( p = 0.008 ) and ketoacidosis ( pH p < 0.001 )."
26062518,"HbA1C levels were negatively related to positive family history of T1DM ( p = 0.01 ) , fasting C - peptide levels ( p = 0.003 ) , IAA levels ( p = 0.03 ) , and IA - 2 levels ( p = 0.003 )."
26062518,"The level of pH was positively influenced by fasting C - peptide ( p = 0.004 ) , and negatively impacted by C - reactive protein ( p = 0.01 ) and non-Caucasian ethnicity ( p = 0.03 )."
26062518,"Conclusion : The milder metabolic decompensation in children with a positive family history of T1DM is probably explained by the awareness of the families in terms of early symptoms of T1DM , while the younger age at onset and the higher levels of autoantibodies may suggest a stronger genetic susceptibility , associated with a more aggressive autoimmune process."
26062518,The younger age in non-Caucasian children is probably explained by the higher genetic susceptibility in subjects belonging to ethnic groups with a low T1DM incidence.
26062518,Social aspects and poor living conditions probably predominate in determining the increased severity of metabolic decompensation at onset in children from non-Caucasian ethnicities.
16357787,Objective : To assess the knowledge about preconception care among women with type 1 diabetes of childbearing age and to identify factors that may be associated with the absence of preconception care.
16357787,"Research design and methods : All women of childbearing age with type 1 diabetes who were seen in 11 Diabetes Centers between December 1 and 12 , 2003 were included."
16357787,An anonymous dual questionnaire was proposed to these women and their consulting diabetologists.
16357787,Results : One hundred and thirty - eight women were included in the study.
16357787,The main reported sources of information about pregnancy were the diabetologist ( 78 % ) and / or specific leaflets ( 42 % ).
16357787,"Although 85 % of the women declared having received information about preconception care , 48 % were unaware of the risk of congenital malformations and 41 % feared for neonatal diabetes."
16357787,"However , 82 % of the women thought that a level of HbA1c below 7 % was a target to achieve before conception."
16357787,"In multivariate analysis , onset of diabetes before the age of 15 was associated with the knowledge that diabetes may be associated with complications during pregnancy ; the use of contraception was associated with knowledge about preconception care ; a high educational level was associated with knowledge that complications are avoidable and that good glycemic control is mandatory before conception."
16357787,"Conclusions : French women with type 1 diabetes , although followed by diabetologists , have major knowledge defects concerning the risks associated with pregnancy."
16357787,This is the first step towards decreasing the rate of unplanned pregnancies in women with type 1 diabetes.
19120293,"This paper reviews worldwide efforts to interdict the type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) disease process , during the stage of evolution of the disease prior to the time of disease onset."
19120293,The goal of intervention before disease onset is to arrest immune destruction and thus prevent or delay clinical disease.
19120293,"In this regard , there have been several large - scale multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials designed to prevent T1D."
19120293,"These have tested nicotinamide , parenteral insulin , oral insulin , nasal insulin , and the elimination of cow 's milk from infant feeding."
10362460,"In Mediterranean countries , the incidence ( per 100,000 per year ) of Type 1 diabetes in children aged under 15 years shows wide variation from country to country , ranging from 2.45 in Macedonia to 34.4 in Sardinia."
10362460,"By interacting with environmental factors such as diet , toxins or viral infections , the HLA plus non-HLA genes of susceptibility or resistance to Type 1 diabetes so far identified are the strongest determinants of the disease as far as incidence , age at onset and sex ratio are concerned."
10362460,The distribution of these genes in the Mediterranean region is still not completely known.
10362460,Sardinians are the most suitable population for studying such phenomena for three main reasons : their genetic features have been repeatedly analysed in depth ; their incidence rate of Type 1 diabetes is by far the highest in the Mediterranean area ; and considerable colonies of Sardinian emigrants settled in neighbouring low - incidence Italian regions.
10362460,Studies on Spaniards and Jews have also contributed to a better understanding of the respective roles of genetic and environmental factors.
10362460,"From a body of research on the Mediterranean populations , it can be concluded that great genetic heterogeneity accounts for the wide variation in incidence of Type 1 diabetes , while rather ubiquitious environmental factors trigger the disease in genetically predisposed individuals."
17546438,Aims / hypothesis : Cognitive performance in type 1 diabetes may be compromised as a result of chronic hyperglycaemia.
17546438,"The aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive functioning of patients with type 1 diabetes ( including a subgroup with a microvascular complication ) and nondiabetic controls , and to assess the relationship between cognition and cerebral grey and white matter volumes."
17546438,"Materials and methods : Twenty - five patients with type 1 diabetes ( of whom ten had proliferative retinopathy ) and nine nondiabetic controls ( matched in terms of sex , age and education ) underwent a neuropsychological examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain."
17546438,Fractional brain tissue volumes ( tissue volume relative to total intracranial volume ) were obtained from each participant.
17546438,"Results : Compared with nondiabetic controls , patients with diabetes performed worse on tests measuring speed of information processing and visuoconstruction ; patients with microvascular disease performed worse on the former cognitive domain ( p = 0.03 ) , whereas patients without complications performed worse on the latter domain ( p = 0.01 )."
17546438,"Patients with a microvascular complication had a significantly smaller white matter volume than nondiabetic controls ( p = 0.04 ) , and smaller white matter volume was associated with worse performance on the domains of speed of information processing and attention and executive function."
17546438,"Conclusions / interpretation : Patients with diabetes demonstrated several subtle neuropsychological deficits , which were found to be related to white matter volume."
17546438,"Since patients with diabetic retinopathy had a smaller white matter volume , this suggests that cognitive decline is at least partly mediated by microvascular disease."
17546438,This needs to be addressed in future studies.
26729037,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) is a chronic immune - mediated disease with a subclinical prodromal period , characterized by selective loss of insulin - producing - β cells in the pancreatic islets of genetically susceptible individuals."
26729037,"The incidence of T1DM has increased several fold in most developed countries since World War II , in conjunction with other immune - mediated diseases."
26729037,Rapid environmental changes and modern lifestyles are probably the driving factors that underlie this increase.
26729037,"These effects might be mediated by changes in the human microbiota , particularly the intestinal microbiota."
26729037,"Research on the gut microbiome of individuals at risk of developing T1DM and in patients with established disease is still in its infancy , but initial findings indicate that the intestinal microbiome of individuals with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus is different to that of healthy individuals."
26729037,"The gut microbiota in individuals with preclinical T1DM is characterized by Bacteroidetes dominating at the phylum level , a dearth of butyrate - producing bacteria , reduced bacterial and functional diversity and low community stability."
26729037,"However , these changes seem to emerge after the appearance of autoantibodies that are predictive of T1DM , which suggests that the intestinal microbiota might be involved in the progression from β - cell autoimmunity to clinical disease rather than in the initiation of the disease process."
23749254,"This study aimed to investigate the association of the anthropometric , clinical variables and maximal oxygen uptake ( Vo2max ) with diabetes - specific health - related quality of life ( HRQoL ) in youths with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) and to find the predictors of HRQoL and blood glucose control."
23749254,A total of 239 youths with diabetes ( 124 boys and 115 girls ) were recruited from diabetes - based summer camps.
23749254,"HRQoL assessment was carried out with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3.0 Diabetes Module ( Information Resources Centre , Mapi Research Trust , France ) ; Vo2max was evaluated by conducting the 20 - m shuttle run test."
23749254,Higher Vo2max and the insulin pump therapy were significant predictors of the HRQoL in the multiple regression analysis ; other clinical and anthropometric variables had no effect.
23749254,The better blood glucose control was explained only by the higher Vo2max.
23749254,The good cardiorespiratory fitness ( expressed by Vo2max ) has clinical and QoL benefits for paediatric patients with T1DM.
28489876,"Aims : To systematically review the evidence of socioeconomic inequalities for adults with type 1 diabetes in relation to mortality , morbidity and diabetes management."
28489876,"Methods : We carried out a systematic search across six relevant databases and included all studies reporting associations between socioeconomic indicators and mortality , morbidity , or diabetes management for adults with type 1 diabetes."
28489876,Data extraction and quality assessment was undertaken for all included studies.
28489876,A narrative synthesis was conducted.
28489876,Results : A total of 33 studies were identified.
28489876,"Twelve cohort , 19 cross sectional and 2 case control studies met the inclusion criteria."
28489876,"Regardless of healthcare system , low socioeconomic status was associated with poorer outcomes."
28489876,"Following adjustments for other risk factors , socioeconomic status was a statistically significant independent predictor of mortality in 9/10 studies and morbidity in 8/10 studies for adults with type 1 diabetes."
28489876,There appeared to be an association between low socioeconomic status and some aspects of diabetes management.
28489876,"Although only 3 of 16 studies made adjustments for confounders and other risk factors , poor diabetes management was associated with lower socioeconomic status in 3/3 of these studies."
28489876,Conclusions : Low socioeconomic status is associated with higher levels of mortality and morbidity for adults with type 1 diabetes even amongst those with access to a universal healthcare system.
28489876,The association between low socioeconomic status and diabetes management requires further research given the paucity of evidence and the potential for diabetes management to mitigate the adverse effects of low socioeconomic status.
24070887,Objective : The purpose of this study was to examine the lived experiences of university students with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
24070887,Methods : University students participated in a 2 - part focus group.
24070887,Transcripts were analyzed thematically using an open - coding approach.
24070887,Data analysis was guided by a framework analysis method and emergent themes were triangulated between study authors for validity.
24070887,"Results : Three major themes identified in this study were food issues within the university environment , lack of diabetes awareness on campus and internal struggles related to the participants ' relationships with their diabetes."
24070887,"Conclusions : Results illustrate some of the unique challenges that interfere with diabetes self - management , academic performance and quality of life among this sample of university students."
24070887,Findings can provide insight for diabetes educators and other healthcare practitioners regarding the issues that may interfere with optimal diabetes self - care in this population.
24070887,Findings also can be used to inform university administrators how to make the university environment more diabetes friendly for its students.
23733895,A series of studies have reported a constant global rise in the incidence of type 1 diabetes.
23733895,"Epidemiological and immunological studies have demonstrated that environmental factors may influence the pathogenesis , leading to a cell - mediated pancreatic β - cell destruction associated with humoral immunity."
23733895,"The search for the triggering factor ( s ) has been going on for the past century , and yet they are still unknown."
23733895,"This review provides an overview of some of the most well - known theories found in the literature : hygiene , viral , vitamin D deficiency , breast milk and cow 's milk hypotheses."
23733895,"Although the hygiene hypothesis appears to be the most promising , positive evidence from animal , human and epidemiological studies precludes us from completely discarding any of the other hypotheses."
23733895,"Moreover , due to contrasting evidence in the literature , a single factor is unlikely to cause an increase in the incidence of diabetes all over the world , which suggests that a multifactorial process might be involved."
23733895,"Although the immunological mechanisms are still unclear , there seems to be some overlap between the various hypotheses."
23733895,It is thought that the emphasis should be shifted from a single to a multifactorial process and that perhaps the ' balance shift ' model should be considered as a possible explanation for the rise in the incidence of type 1 diabetes.
